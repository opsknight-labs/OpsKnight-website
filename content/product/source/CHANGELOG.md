## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-02

OpsKnight 2.0 is a major release of the self-hosted incident-response platform. It introduces a scalable runtime architecture, a durable notification pipeline, expanded identity and ChatOps controls, production deployment options, and a fully rebuilt source-verified documentation set.

### New headline capabilities

- **Split production runtime:** Web, Scheduler, General Worker, Critical Worker, Bulk Worker, and Status Projector can scale independently. The integrated runtime remains supported.
- **Notification delivery control plane:** Durable logical intents, provider attempts, traffic classes, admission/defer behavior, retry and terminal states, callback reconciliation, provider capacity controls, and an administrator Operations view. Delivery evidence distinguishes deferred, retrying, accepted, delivered, permanent-failure, and superseded work.
- **Microsoft Teams ChatOps:** Entra application and Azure Bot integration, Teams app packaging and tenant installation, service-to-channel destinations, Adaptive Cards, interactive incident actions, identity linking, war rooms, participant synchronization, and meeting collaboration. A service can target up to three Teams destinations.
- **Twilio voice paging:** `VOICE` is a triggered-incident paging channel with responder acknowledgement input, signed callbacks, and reconciliation of uncertain provider outcomes. Acknowledge and resolve lifecycle updates do not initiate additional voice calls.
- **Incident response policy engine:** Versioned classification, incident SLA, and support-hours policies at workspace and service scope, with immutable published versions, preview, history, diff, restore, and API access.
- **SCIM 2.0 provisioning:** Users, Groups, discovery endpoints, provisioning/deprovisioning, team membership, PATCH operations, and in-product bearer-token generation, rotation, and revocation.
- **Auditor access and sessions:** A read-oriented `AUDITOR` role, centralized resource authorization, OIDC claim mapping, and a canonical signed-in-session registry with browser, OS, device, authentication type, activity, expiry, and revoke controls.
- **Privacy and compliance operations:** Privacy/DSAR request processing, export and erasure evidence, retention holds, controlled encryption migrations, technical control evaluation, framework mappings, evidence ledgers, drift monitoring, and verifiable evidence-package exports. Framework mapping does not confer external certification.
- **Docker Swarm:** Integrated and split stacks, Raft secrets, direct-database migration lifecycle, health checks, topology switching, and rollback tooling.
- **Deployment planning and load certification:** Workload shapes and multi-topology load/correctness tests cover ingestion, incident lifecycle, escalation, notification fanout, realtime delivery, status fanout, and recovery.
- **ManageEngine ingestion:** A new native inbound parser joins the existing integration catalog. The release certifies 28 current inbound contracts in total; it does not add 28 new integrations.

### Major rebuilds of existing capabilities

- **Incident response:** Centralized lifecycle commands, durable side effects, persistent idempotency, stale-worker fencing, a global create modal, templates, stronger validation, rebuilt incident detail, action items, and interactive 5-Whys postmortems.
- **Schedules and escalation:** Redesigned schedule setup/detail, DST-safe rotations, overrides and handoff behavior, user/team/schedule escalation targets, priority/urgency/support-hours conditions, durable recovery, and stale-work protection.
- **Slack and Jira:** More reliable Slack war rooms, identity and capability controls, up to three Slack destinations per service, provider-neutral collaboration, and stronger bidirectional Jira lifecycle reconciliation.
- **Quiet Hours:** Personal timezone-aware suppression for low-urgency notifications; medium- and high-urgency operational paging bypasses Quiet Hours.
- **Status Page V3:** One supported status page with themes, announcements, subscriber verification/unsubscribe, API tokens, webhooks, privacy controls, uptime history/export, rebuild-safe snapshots, and hardened routing. Multiple status pages are not a supported 2.0 capability.
- **Dashboards and reports:** Templates, configurable widgets, persisted layout, private/team/organization visibility, filtered share links, PDF export, live refresh, and fullscreen NOC/TV presentation mode.
- **Responder-grade mobile PWA:** Rebuilt mobile navigation and operational workflows, per-device push registration and reconciliation, repair flows, offline/cached-state boundaries, update handling, and hardened fresh-install iOS Web Push recovery. This is an installable PWA, not a native App Store application.
- **OIDC and SSO policy:** Entra, Google, Okta, Auth0, and generic provider flows with PKCE/nonce, JIT provisioning, explicit account linking, claim-to-role mapping, provider lifecycle hardening, maximum lifetime, update interval, idle timeout, and reauthentication controls.
- **Application bootstrap and routing:** Short-lived first-admin bootstrap capability, UI-managed Application URL, canonical-host enforcement, reverse-proxy awareness, and explicit HTTP 421 protection.
- **Health and operations:** Expanded Health Center diagnostics, Prometheus metrics, system logs, backup/restore, worker/readiness visibility, and PgBouncer-aware connection ownership.

### Explicit 2.0 boundaries

- Service Objectives/SLO UI is deferred; its route redirects and it is not advertised as a released feature.
- OpsKnight 2.0 supports one status page, not multiple status pages.
- Postmortem analysis is user-driven; the release does not claim AI correlation or AI-generated postmortems.
- OpsKnight remains self-hosted and does not introduce a hosted OpsKnight Cloud service.
- Mobile delivery is an installable PWA, not native iOS or Android store applications.
- Voice is triggered-incident paging, not a call on every later incident state change.
- The 28 inbound integration contracts are the current total contract set, not 28 newly added integrations.
- **Documentation:** The 2.0 task-oriented documentation is backed by implementation discovery, semantic contracts, runtime evidence, API smoke tests, legacy-knowledge mapping, and rendered-site validation.
- **License:** OpsKnight 2.0.0 is the first stable release distributed under `AGPL-3.0-only`. OpsKnight 1.4.0 and earlier retain their historical licenses.

### Upgrade from 1.4

This is a major-version migration. Before upgrading:

1. Back up PostgreSQL and prove that the backup restores.
2. Preserve `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`; do not generate replacements.
3. Configure the externally reachable Application URL before testing redirects, webhooks, OIDC, ChatOps, or push.
4. Run schema migrations through a direct PostgreSQL connection, not PgBouncer.
5. Choose integrated or split topology and validate the database connection budget.
6. Re-test inbound integrations and every configured delivery provider.
7. Record the rollback boundary and complete rollback before accepting incompatible 2.0 writes.

Read [Migrate from v1](docs/v2.0.0/start/migrate-from-v1.md), [database migrations](docs/v2.0.0/operate/upgrades/database-migrations.md), and [rollback](docs/v2.0.0/operate/upgrades/rollback.md) before the maintenance window.

### Added & Enhanced

- **Webhook Ingestion Reliability & Auto-Recovery**:
  - **GitLab CI/CD**: Scoped pipeline deduplication keys to project + ref + buildName so succeeding runs properly auto-resolve failing runs.
  - **Zabbix Integration**: Fixed signature provider configuration from `gitlab` to `generic` HMAC; prioritized trigger ID, problem ID, and `r_event_id` over dynamic event IDs to ensure recovery webhooks deterministically match open incidents.
  - **Sentry, Prometheus & AWS CloudWatch Schemas**: Tolerated nullable fields (`assignedTo: null`, `AlarmDescription: null`), unhandled action verbs (`triggered`, `reopened`), and flexible timestamp encodings in Zod validation schemas.
  - **Datadog Deduplication**: Stripped standard status prefixes (`[Triggered]`, `[Recovered]`, `[OK]`, `[Warn]`) before fallback title hashing to ensure alert recovery matches.
  - **Integration Key Comparison**: Pre-hashed integration keys with SHA-256 before `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to eliminate secret length timing leaks.

### Security & Hardening

- **Authentication & Session Security**:
  - **Administrative Reset Links**: Automatically invoked `revokeUserSessions(userId)` upon generating administrative reset links to immediately terminate compromised sessions.
  - **IP Rate Limiting**: Extracted and sanitized leftmost client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` across password reset and admin reset link endpoints to prevent rate-limit evasion.
  - **OIDC Synchronization**: Bumped `tokenVersion` on user role updates during OIDC group mapping sync.
  - **Setup Hardening**: Wrapped post-creation `logAudit` in defensive error handling during admin bootstrap to eliminate permanent instance lockouts.
  - **RBAC**: Restricted team `OWNER` role assignments in `addUserToTeam` exclusively to administrators.
- **Web Push Subscription Isolation & API Caching**:
  - Automatically purged conflicting subscriptions on shared browser endpoints during push registration; enforced `NetworkOnly` Service Worker caching across all root and nested authenticated API endpoints to eliminate stale cache leakage.

### Fixed

- **SLA Analytics Math & Precision**:
  - **Zero-Item Datasets**: Returned `null` instead of `0` for MTTA and MTTR when zero incidents are acknowledged/resolved, preventing false "100% improvement" insight alerts.
  - **Timezone Alignment**: Aligned `trendSeries` calendar points and historical rollup query ranges with user timezone days so negative UTC offset timezones (`America/New_York`) do not drop edge days.
  - **Business Hours Robustness**: Added `try/catch` fallback to `DEFAULT_BUSINESS_HOURS_TIMEZONE` in `isIncidentAfterHours` to prevent unhandled `RangeError` on invalid timezone strings.
  - **Metric Merging**: Added `Number.isFinite` guards in `reconstructMet` and `calculateMtbfMs` to eliminate `NaN` propagation.
- **On-Call Scheduling DST Anchoring & Block Merging**:
  - Calendar-anchored sub-daily shift rotations (12h, 8h, 6h) in the schedule timezone to eliminate wall-clock drift across Daylight Saving Time transitions; merged contiguous schedule blocks for the same responder across rotation and override boundaries; filtered deactivated users in shift window aggregations and added null-safe fallbacks for deleted override users.
- **Web Push Delivery Resilience & PWA Hardening**:
  - Safely normalized action payloads to prevent `JSON.parse` crashes during dispatch; made device token purges and HTTP 410/404 cleanup idempotent (`deleteMany`) to prevent concurrent worker exceptions.
  - Handled `pointercancel` in `MobileSwipeNavigator` to abort tab transitions during native vertical scrolling; isolated modal and bottom sheet backdrops with `data-swipe-ignore`; enforced 16px minimum font size on mobile inputs to eliminate iOS Safari viewport auto-zoom displacement.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added & Enhanced

- **Administrator Health Center**: Consolidated supported database, migration, scheduler, worker, escalation, notification-provider, integration, public URL, encryption, version, and upgrade signals in one administrative view; retired the standalone performance dashboard and removed misleading process-memory and operator-attestation backup signals.
- **Release-Quality Contract**: Added automated clean-install, previous-release upgrade, migration-failure, backup/restore, incident lifecycle, escalation delivery, Helm/Kustomize rendering, documentation coverage, and tagged AMD64/ARM64 release checks.
- **Deployment Reliability**: Added fail-closed migration startup with bounded recovery and multi-architecture stable container publishing; retained fast AMD64-only builds for the continuously updated test image.
- **Modern In-Process Avatar Ecosystem**: Migrated to local in-process `@dicebear/core` and `@dicebear/collection` rendering (eliminating external HTTP calls to `api.dicebear.com`); added professional vector styles (`bottts`, `shapes`, `initials`, `pixel-art`, `avataaars`, `lorelei`, `micah`, `identicon`) with gender-based selection, SVG XML entity sanitization, and strict CSP headers.
- **Admin-Controlled OIDC Account Linking**: Added explicit, reversible admin controls in user management to approve or revoke OIDC account linking, preventing account takeovers while allowing secure initial sign-in for invited team members.
- **Comprehensive Documentation & Operations Runbooks**: Published complete v1.3 capability inventory (`docs/V1_3_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`), 15-minute golden path getting-started guide, production deployment runbooks for Docker, Kubernetes & Helm, database backup & disaster recovery procedures, and updated container registries to `ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight`.

### Security & Hardening

- **Bootstrap, OIDC & Readiness Hardening**: Serialized first-administrator creation with conflict retry, prevented disabled users from being reactivated through OIDC linking, and replaced internal scheduler errors in public readiness responses with a safe status message.
- **Dependency Security Baseline**: Updated Next.js, Auth.js, Nodemailer, and vulnerable transitive packages to patched releases identified by the release security scan.
- **Admin-Only Event Logs & Audit Log Access**: Enforced `assertAdmin()` on the Event Logs page (`/events`) and Audit Log page (`/audit`); restricted Event Logs and Audit Log sidebar navigation links strictly to users with the `ADMIN` role (`requiresRole: ['ADMIN']`); removed restricted administrative links (Audit Logs, Notification Providers, Performance Monitoring) from the settings overview, navigation, and search for standard users and responders.
- **Web Push Subscription Isolation & API Caching**: Automatically purge conflicting subscriptions on shared browser endpoints during push registration; enforced `NetworkOnly` Service Worker caching across all root and nested authenticated API endpoints to eliminate 24-hour stale cache leakage.
- **API Security, IDOR Mitigation & Role Validation**: Added `assertCanViewIncident(id)` on incident telemetry context; converted session role checks to database-verified `assertAdmin()` on SLA definitions, public logs, and retention endpoints; added positive integer boundary validation (`1–3650`) for data retention policies; enforced team-scoped access on Slack test notifications and widget feeds.
- **Structured Logging Redaction**: Enhanced logger sanitization before stdout/stderr and ingestion endpoints to redact authorization headers, bearer tokens, Slack bot tokens, AWS keys, phone numbers, and webhook secrets; added circular reference protection via `WeakSet`.
- **Database Concurrency & Transaction Atomicity**: Wrapped policy step creation and re-indexing in atomic `prisma.$transaction`; enforced last active administrator checks across multi-user bulk batches; deduplicated custom field insertions to eliminate unique constraint collisions (`P2002`).
- **Alert Ingestion & Webhook Reliability**: Added defensive object coercion across all 24 ingestion transformers; added escalation fallback to service team members and administrators when escalation policies resolve to zero active responders.
- **Incident State Transitions & Concurrency**: Cleared stale `resolvedAt` timestamps when transitioning out of `RESOLVED` to prevent MTTR/SLA metric distortion; applied atomic state guards (`status: 'OPEN'` / `status: 'SNOOZED'`) to Slack interactive action buttons and auto-unsnooze background workers to eliminate TOCTOU race conditions; added typed event logging on bulk actions.
- **Authentication & Sessions**: Added OIDC nonce state validation and strict email verification check on invited user linking; enforced `tokenVersion` check in JWT fallback path for immediate session revocation on role changes or password resets; wrapped bootstrap admin initialization in an atomic transaction; protected last active administrator from demotion/deletion; prevented responders from demoting team owners.
- **CSV Formula Injection Mitigation (CWE-1236)**: Implemented strict sanitization (`buildCsv` / `sanitizeCsvCell`) prepending quotes to formula triggers (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, `\r`, `|`, `%`) across uptime reports and analytics exports.
- **Status Page & Subscriber Protection**: Replaced automatic GET-based unsubscribe mutation with an explicit confirmation form to block anti-spam scanner unsubscriptions; added SVG script/event-handler sanitization and strict CSP on logo endpoints; enforced private incident visibility filtering (`visibility !== 'PUBLIC'`) across status page notifications, webhooks, and RSS feeds.
- **Custom Fields Validation & RBAC**: Added strict type validation and regex parsing for custom field types (`NUMBER`, `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `SELECT`, `EMAIL`, `URL`) and enforced `assertCanModifyIncident` RBAC.
- **Template IDOR Mitigation**: Enforced author and admin role checks before deleting incident templates.

### Fixed

- **On-Call Scheduling DST Anchoring & Block Merging**: Calendar-anchored sub-daily shift rotations (12h, 8h, 6h) in the schedule timezone to eliminate wall-clock drift across Daylight Saving Time transitions; merged contiguous schedule blocks for the same responder across rotation and override boundaries; filtered deactivated users in shift window aggregations and added null-safe fallbacks for deleted override users.
- **Web Push Delivery Resilience**: Safely normalized action payloads to prevent `JSON.parse` crashes during dispatch; made device token purges and HTTP 410/404 cleanup idempotent (`deleteMany`) to prevent concurrent worker exceptions.
- **Mobile PWA & Touch Gesture Isolation**: Handled `pointercancel` in `MobileSwipeNavigator` to abort tab transitions during native vertical scrolling; isolated modal and bottom sheet backdrops with `data-swipe-ignore`; enforced 16px minimum font size on mobile inputs to eliminate iOS Safari viewport auto-zoom displacement.
- **Paging Reliability**: Restored orphaned escalation processing through a single atomic claim, preserved policy delays without immediately paging a fallback team, and eliminated duplicate service notifications on genuine escalation fallback.
- **Mobile PWA & Accessibility (a11y)**: Restored trigger element focus on modal/dialog cleanup via `trapFocus`; added `role="switch"`, `aria-checked`, and Enter/Space keyboard handlers to `MobileThemeToggle` and `MobileBiometricToggle`; added `role="alertdialog"`, theme background tokens, and focus trapping to confirmation dialogs; added `role="listbox"` and `aria-expanded` to analytics date range picker; added `aria-label` and `aria-pressed` to schedule layer restriction day buttons; cleaned up chord keydown event listeners on timeout.
- **Observability & Health Checks**: Cleared `setTimeout` timer handles in health check database probe; evaluated memory pressure against V8 maximum heap limit (`v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit`); added background scheduler state check; eliminated N+1 database queries in SLA breach monitor by pre-fetching active warning events.
- **ChatOps & Postmortem Lifecycle**: Atomically reserved Slack pin records in transaction before note creation to eliminate duplicate notes; guarded Jira sync against out-of-order stale webhooks using event timestamps; included incident notes and sorted chronological timeline events in postmortem drafts.
- **Notification Routing & Multi-Channel Delivery**: Eliminated mock-mode false positive successes in Email and Push dispatchers so fallback channels (SMS, WhatsApp) activate when primary providers are unconfigured; wrapped channel dispatchers in throwing callbacks inside `CircuitBreaker.execute` to ensure circuit breakers trip during third-party provider outages; validated `whatsappContentSid` before marking WhatsApp available; attributed recipient names in timeline events; evaluated `startHour === endHour` as 24-hour round-the-clock coverage.
- **Distributed Cron & Job Queue**: Ensured standby replicas schedule their next check with randomized jitter when failing to acquire leader locks, enabling High Availability leader failover; updated job queue maintenance to prune failed jobs based on `failedAt`.
- **Client SSE Reconnection**: Standardized exponential backoff with full jitter ($\pm 20\%$) across all client SSE streaming hooks (`useEventStream`, `useNotificationStream`, `useRealtime`) to eliminate thundering herd reconnection storms.
- **Analytics, SLA Metrics & PDF Export**: Accurately calculated MTBF for zero- and single-incident datasets across observation window bounds; aligned trend series generation with user timezone calendar boundaries; added negative interval guards to historical SQL aggregates; fixed multi-service uptime calculations for resolved incidents using `updatedAt`; rebuilt PDF export with accurate UTF-8 byte lengths, valid `xref` offsets, and pagination.
- **Mobile PWA, Web Push & Touch UX**: Resolved swipe conflicts between `MobileSwipeNavigator` and modal/sheet controls; fixed iOS Safari background rubber-band scrolling via `.mobile-content` container lock; added fallback WebAuthn biometric credential resolution; automatically disabled push notifications on 410/404 Gone device endpoints.
- **Postmortems & Timelines**: Preserved `publishedAt` timestamp on edits and cleared on `DRAFT`; deduplicated synthetic lifecycle markers when database events exist; fixed timezone offset drift on datetime-local inputs; auto-completed Action Items on Jira ticket resolution.
- **Audit Logs & Export**: Added structured audit logging for API key creation/revocation, notification provider updates, VAPID rotation, retention policies, and manual data purges; added safety query limit (`take: 100`) to team audit logs.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **6 New Native Observability & APM Integrations**:
  - **Zabbix** — native webhook media type support for Problem/Recovery/Update alerts with 6-level severity mapping and `EVENT.ID` recovery deduplication
  - **PagerDuty Events API v2** — ingest adapter for `trigger`, `acknowledge`, and `resolve` with routing key resolution. Not a PagerDuty product.
  - **GitLab CI/CD** — automated pipeline failure alerting and branch-level auto-resolution on successful rerun
  - **Vercel Deployments** — production error triggering, deployment state tracking, and auto-resolution on successful deployment
  - **Nagios Core & XI** — macro parsing with scheduled downtime (`DOWNTIMESTART`), flapping, and service state transitions
  - **Icinga 2** — full host/service state transitions and acknowledgment handling
- **Forensic Ingestion Security & Authentication**:
  - Mandatory integration key verification and timing-safe HMAC checks (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) across all 24 webhook routes
  - Collision-proof 32-character SHA-256 deduplication hashing replacing legacy 100-character string slicing
  - Outbound webhook timestamp binding (`X-OpsKnight-Timestamp` in HMAC) to eliminate replay attack vectors
- **Core Resilience & Runtime Hardening**:
  - Webhook circuit breaker with `halfOpenRequestInFlight` concurrency locking to eliminate thundering herd spikes during service recovery
  - Rolling 5-minute deduplication window for notification queue processing
  - Sequential notification fallback chain (`push -> sms -> whatsapp -> email`) with High/Critical multi-channel escalation
  - Next.js navigation error propagation (`isRedirectError`, `isNotFoundError`) in server action wrappers
  - Fallback RBAC permission safely assigns unauthenticated sessions to `VIEWER` with `authenticated: false`
- **Official Organization Migration**:
  - Migrated repository and container packages to `ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight` with public anonymous pull support

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **Slack ChatOps incident war rooms** — a dedicated Slack channel per qualifying
  incident, with on-call responders auto-invited, an incident command card, and
  an optional Jitsi/Zoom/Google Meet bridge
- **One-click actions** in Slack: Acknowledge, Assign to Me and Resolve
- **Slash commands** — `/incident ack | resolve | note | who | postmortem | help`
- **📌 emoji pin sync** — react to any message in a war room to capture it as an
  incident note; pinning is idempotent
- **Slack app manifest generator** — copy a complete manifest configuring every
  scope, the events subscription, interactivity and the slash command in one step
- Signing secret is entered in the UI and stored encrypted, no environment
  variable required
- Setup documentation for Slack ChatOps, including scope reference and
  troubleshooting

### Fixed

- **On-call resolution paged the entire schedule on Node 20.** `hour12: false`
  resolves to the h24 hour cycle on Node 20's ICU, reporting midnight as hour
  "24" and shifting start-of-day a full day early in zero-offset zones. No block
  covered "now", so the roster fallback paged everyone instead of the person on
  call
- Slack request signatures are now verified and **fail closed**; previously a
  missing secret caused every unsigned request to be trusted
- Server-side request forgery via `response_url`, which was fetched unvalidated
- "Assign to Me" could assign an incident to an arbitrary user when Slack user
  resolution failed
- The Acknowledge button did not stop the escalation chain
- Slack button actions did not send notifications the equivalent web actions did
- Incident timeline showed raw Slack IDs (`<@U0673U4TWAJ>`) instead of names
- War-room API required only authentication, not permission on the incident
- Manual **Create War-Room** and **Archive** were blocked by settings that govern
  automatic behaviour
- Slack rate limits (429) crashed some code paths and were swallowed on others
- Archived war rooms no longer read as active, and no longer receive updates
- Emoji reaction sync requested the scopes it needs (`reactions:read`,
  `channels:history`, `groups:history`)

### Changed

- Watchtower removed from the production compose file; image rollout is now a
  deliberate action
- `engines` pins Node 20 to match the production image
- Pinned messages are saved as an incident note only, without a duplicate
  timeline event

### Added

- Initial GitHub Issue Templates (Bug Report, Feature Request, Config)
- Community Health files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)

### Changed

- Updated repository description to match brand guidelines.
- Updated README to reflect Beta status.
