# Troubleshoot Jira

## Connection test fails

Confirm the base URL, credentials, project permission, and encrypted settings.
Run the test again only after correcting the visible failure.

## Issue creation fails

Verify the project key and issue type exist and that required Jira fields are
available. Inspect the incident operation before retrying.

## Webhook updates do not appear

Confirm the integration is enabled, the shared secret matches, and Jira is
sending a handled event. Check for `429` responses and preserve the Atlassian
webhook identifier when diagnosing duplicate or delayed delivery.
