# Slack ChatOps

Connect one Slack workspace to deliver incident lifecycle messages, accept
interactive responder actions, run `/incident` commands, and create incident
war rooms. Start with [Connect Slack using OAuth](./connect-with-oauth), then
map service destinations.

## Choose a task

- [Connect Slack using OAuth](./connect-with-oauth)
- [Configure service channels](./configure-service-channels)
- [Use incident actions and commands](./incident-actions)
- [Create and operate war rooms](./war-rooms)
- [Link responder identities](./user-identity-linking)
- [Review permissions and scopes](./permissions-and-scopes)
- [Troubleshoot Slack](./troubleshooting)

## How the pieces relate

The OAuth installation authorizes the OpsKnight bot. Service destinations
control routine lifecycle delivery. Identity links authorize user-attributed
actions. War rooms are separate incident-scoped channels with their own
lifecycle. Configuring one does not implicitly configure the others.
