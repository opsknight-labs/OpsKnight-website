# Link Slack responder identities

## Before you begin

Sign in to OpsKnight as the responder whose Slack account you are linking.

## Open the feature

Select an incident action in Slack and follow the identity-link prompt, or open **Settings → ChatOps identity** in OpsKnight.

## Configure the identity

Confirm the Slack workspace/user and signed-in OpsKnight account are your own. Identity linking attributes actions; it does not grant product permission.

## Complete the action

1. Open your identity-link prompt.
2. Complete the signed flow while authenticated as yourself.
3. Retry the Slack action.
4. Verify the OpsKnight timeline attributes the action to your account.

## What OpsKnight does

OpsKnight stores the provider/workspace/user mapping and still evaluates current role, service scope, action policy, and incident state for every request.

## Verify it worked

Perform an allowed action on a controlled incident. Confirm actor attribution in the OpsKnight timeline and convergence of every Slack projection.

## Remove or change the link

Administrators should remove stale mappings when a Slack account or OpsKnight user is deactivated or ownership changes, then complete a new signed link. Never share an identity-link URL.

## Troubleshooting

**Prompt repeats:** confirm the signed link was completed while authenticated as the matching active OpsKnight account.

**Linked but forbidden:** identity succeeded; check OpsKnight permissions/service scope and current incident state.

**Wrong actor:** stop actions, remove the mapping, review timeline/audit evidence, and link the correct account.
