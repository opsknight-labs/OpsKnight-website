# Troubleshoot Microsoft Teams

## Installation is not detected

Verify the configured tenant ID, Azure Bot endpoint, application package ID,
and that the bot is installed in the target team.

## Cards are not delivered

Test the exact destination. Confirm its installation remains enabled and its
service URL is trusted. Inspect the notification operation and provider result.

## Card actions return forbidden

Check Bot token validation, tenant match, installation and destination scope,
identity mapping, and OpsKnight authorization. The inbound activity limit is
enforced before processing; oversized requests return `413`.

## War-room creation fails

Verify the target team granted the optional war-room RSC permissions. Inspect
the collaboration operation before retrying because channel creation can
succeed remotely even when the response is ambiguous.
