# Configure Microsoft Teams war rooms

## Before you begin

Complete the base Teams installation and obtain permission to grant optional
resource-specific consent in the target team.

War rooms require additional resource-specific consent beyond ordinary card
delivery. Enable war-room permissions in the generated package, reinstall or
update it in the target team, then select the war-room destination for the
service.

In a provisioned incident channel, the card can include the video bridge and
the actions available to the signed-in responder.

## Open the feature

As administrator, open **Settings → Integrations → Microsoft Teams** to generate/update the app package. Then open **Services → select service → Notifications → Microsoft Teams** to select the one destination that owns automatic war-room behavior. Responders create/manage the room from the incident collaboration controls.

## Configure war-room consent

1. Enable war-room permissions in the generated application package.
2. Reinstall or update the package in the target team.
3. Select the service destination that owns automatic war-room behavior.
4. Create a test incident room and verify its lifecycle.

Channel creation needs `Channel.Create.Group` and
`TeamsAppInstallation.Read.Group`. Lifecycle and membership features add
`ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.Group`, `TeamMember.Read.Group`,
`ChannelMember.Read.Group`, and `ChannelMember.ReadWrite.Group`.

Verify creation, marker reconciliation, membership synchronization, message
projection, and terminal cleanup before production use.

## What OpsKnight does

OpsKnight creates/links an incident-scoped Teams channel, stores durable identifiers/markers, publishes incident context, reconciles membership and cards, and performs terminal cleanup. The incident remains authoritative. Only one destination per service owns automatic war-room behavior.

## Verify it worked

Confirm the channel appears in the intended team, normal incident context and optional video bridge/actions are correct, expected members synchronize, card actions update OpsKnight, and closure performs documented cleanup.

## Remove or change the war room

Close/reconcile it from OpsKnight rather than manually deleting the Teams channel. To change owner destination, finish/open-room coordination, select the new service destination, and test with a new incident; do not assume existing remote rooms migrate.

## Troubleshooting

**Channel creation forbidden:** verify optional RSC permissions and team-level consent/package update.

**Room exists but OpsKnight reports ambiguity:** inspect collaboration operation/markers before retrying to avoid duplicate channels.

**Membership fails:** verify Team/Channel member read/write RSC and target user availability.
