# AppDynamics

## What it does

The AppDynamics adapter accepts inbound webhook events at
`/api/integrations/appdynamics`, validates them through its custom handler,
normalizes provider payloads, and submits lifecycle events to the configured
service.

## Prerequisites

- An OpsKnight service and enabled integration record.
- The integration identifier and generated integration key.
- Permission to configure webhooks in AppDynamics.
- A network path from the provider to the OpsKnight web runtime.

## Setup and configuration

1. In OpsKnight, open **Services → your service → Integrations**.
2. Select **Add integration → AppDynamics**, then save the integration.
3. Copy the webhook URL and integration key shown by OpsKnight.
4. In AppDynamics, open **Alert & Respond → HTTP Request Templates**, create a template, and set its method to `POST` and content type to JSON.
5. Paste the complete OpsKnight URL. Build the body with the health-rule/event name, `eventType`, severity, application/entity identity, and a stable violation or event ID; use the same ID for the close event.
6. Create an HTTP Request action from the template, attach it to the health-rule policy for both open and close events, then start and clear a non-production violation.

Provider console labels can change independently of OpsKnight. Use the webhook
or notification configuration area in the provider rather than copying a URL
from another service. Treat keys and signature secrets as credentials; never
place them in logs or source control.

## Authentication and request verification

The endpoint requires the integration identifier and validates the integration key using a timing-safe comparison.
Signature verification is **conditional-when-secret-configured** using the
`generic` verification contract.
The exact payload schema is defined by `src/app/api/integrations/appdynamics/route.ts` and `src/lib/integrations/appdynamics.ts`.

- Method: `POST`
- Integration identifier: query parameter
- Integration key transports: `Authorization: Bearer`, `Authorization: Token token=`, `x-integration-key`, `x-api-key`, `integrationKey query parameter`
- Schema: `shared provider schema`
- Body limit: 1048576 bytes (1 MiB)
- Rate limit: 100 requests per 60 seconds, per integration
## Event mapping and incident lifecycle

The adapter emits the lifecycle actions found in its current source:
- `trigger`
- `acknowledge`
- `resolve`
Correlation contract: **adapter EventPayload.dedup_key**. Recovery contract: **adapter emits resolve for its recovery state**.
## Recovery and deduplication

When signature verification runs, the shared handler attempts provider-specific delivery identity before claiming the inbound-delivery fence.
Incident convergence still depends on the adapter correlation key. Failed
deliveries are recorded for operational inspection without exposing secrets.
## Limits and testing

Per-integration rate limiting protects the ingestion path. Send a representative
trigger and recovery pair in a non-production service, verify that one incident
is created, and confirm that recovery updates that incident rather than creating
another.

## Verify the connection

After the test alert, confirm all of the following:

- One incident appears for the selected OpsKnight service.
- The incident source identifies AppDynamics.
- A repeat event updates or correlates according to the adapter identity.
- A recovery event resolves the correlated incident.

## Error reference

- `400` — Invalid request or payload validation failed.
- `401` — Integration is disabled, mismatched, or unauthorized.
- `404` — Integration record was not found.
- `413` — Payload exceeds the one MiB body limit.
- `429` — Per-integration request rate exceeded.
- `503` — A matching delivery is already being processed.
## Troubleshooting

1. Confirm the integration is enabled and belongs to the intended service.
2. Verify the integration ID in the URL and rotate any key that may have been exposed.
3. Inspect the webhook HTTP response body and system logs for validation or signature errors.
4. Check for `413` before changing payload templates and `429` before retrying rapidly.
5. Confirm the provider sends a state supported by the event mapping above.
6. Preserve the provider delivery identifier and timestamp when escalating.

## Security

Use HTTPS, rotate exposed keys at both systems, configure signature verification
when supported, and restrict provider egress or ingress controls without blocking
legitimate retries.
