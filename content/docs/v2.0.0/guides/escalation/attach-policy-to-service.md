# Attach an escalation policy to a service

![Escalation policy detail before attaching it to a service](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/escalation-policy-detail.png)

## Before you begin

Create/validate a policy and confirm its targets/channels are suitable for the service. Identify change window and current incidents affected by existing policy generations.

## Open the feature

Open **Services → select service → escalation/response configuration**.

## Configure the attachment

1. Select the intended escalation policy.
2. Review service ownership, urgency/notification context, and policy name.
3. Save the service.
4. Reopen/refresh and confirm the selected policy remains.

## What OpsKnight does

New incident escalation uses the service's selected policy and records/executed generation according to product lifecycle. Changing the service does not recall notifications already sent for active incidents.

## Verify it worked

Create a controlled incident on that exact service and inspect attached policy/current step/target plus delivered notification. A policy directory view alone is insufficient.

## Change or undo it

Reattach the prior valid policy, save, and retest. Never leave a production service without a viable escalation route during replacement.

## Troubleshooting

**Policy absent from selector:** verify it exists, access/tenant scope, and current validity.

**Incident uses unexpected policy:** confirm incident service and creation time versus service change; inspect recorded generation/current state.
