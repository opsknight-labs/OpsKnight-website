# Configure an escalation policy

![Escalation policy directory with operational ownership](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/escalation-policies.png)

Create a policy, add ordered steps, select each user, team, or schedule target,
choose the delay and notification channels, and save. Attach the policy to a
test service and trigger an incident.

Verify that step order is unique, every target resolves to an eligible recipient,
and configured channels have usable endpoints. A syntactically valid policy can
still be operationally empty when its target has no active members or coverage.
