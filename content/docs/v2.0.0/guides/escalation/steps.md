# Configure escalation policy steps

## Before you begin

Prepare active targets and usable channel endpoints. A schedule needs effective coverage at incident time; a team needs eligible members/lead according to target mode.

## Open the feature

Open **Escalation policies → select policy → Steps**.

## Configure a step

1. Add or select a step position.
2. Choose target type and exact user/team/schedule.
3. Choose notification channel(s) supported by intended responders.
4. Configure delay/retries according to [timing](./retries-delays).
5. Save and add later fallback steps.

## What OpsKnight does

OpsKnight resolves targets at execution, filters ineligible recipients/endpoints, and creates delivery work with the policy/incident generation. Changes affect later execution according to current state; they do not recall already emitted pages.

## Verify it worked

Review every target and total path, then run a controlled test at a time the schedule/team resolution is known. Confirm actual recipient/channel matches.

## Remove or change a step

Preserve at least one viable route and review service impact before reordering/deleting. Retest the complete fallback chain after changes.

## Troubleshooting

**Step saves but no recipient:** inspect active user/team membership/schedule coverage and personal channel eligibility.

**Wrong member paged:** inspect execution timestamp and runtime team/schedule target resolution.

## Next steps

- [Configure retries and delays](./retries-delays)
- [Test policy](./test-policy)
