# Configure a notification provider

![Notification settings with provider configuration and operational controls](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/notification-settings.png)

## Before you begin

Use an administrator account. Obtain provider credentials with least privilege, verified sender/domain or phone identity, permitted regions/recipients, and known rate/concurrency limits. Confirm the public OpsKnight origin and outbound network policy.

## Open the feature

Open **Settings → Notifications** and select the provider/channel configuration.

## Configure the provider

1. Choose the supported provider and enable it only after fields are ready.
2. Enter the provider-specific credential and sender/region/host/port fields shown.
3. For SMTP, configure host, port, user, password, sender, and TLS mode correctly.
4. For Resend/SendGrid/SES, use the exact API/access credentials and verified from-address/region.
5. For SMS/voice/push, complete the provider-specific endpoint/account/application settings shown and linked reference.
6. Save, then run a test to a controlled recipient.

## What OpsKnight does

OpsKnight encrypts stored provider secrets, evaluates enabled providers/endpoints/routing, creates durable notification intents, and records provider attempts/outcomes. Saving credentials does not prove provider acceptance or human receipt.

## Verify it worked

Confirm provider health/test result and actual controlled delivery. Inspect notification history for intent, attempt, provider identifier/outcome, and terminal/retry state. Then run a synthetic incident through the intended escalation/service route.

## Change or undo it

For rotation, create the new provider credential, update OpsKnight, test, then revoke the old credential. To disable, first inventory affected routes/responders and provide an alternate channel. Retest after any sender/domain/region/network change.

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication rejected:** confirm credential value/type, account/region, revocation/expiry, and server clock.

**Provider accepts but recipient does not receive:** inspect suppression/spam/carrier/device state and provider delivery feedback; sent is not delivered.

**Secret decryption fails:** restore the matching `ENCRYPTION_KEY`; re-enter credentials only through controlled rotation.
