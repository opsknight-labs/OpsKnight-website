# Test notification delivery

## Before you begin

Configure provider, route, recipient endpoint/preferences, and a non-production service or approved window. Tell the test recipient and choose a unique title/time.

## Open the feature

Use **Settings → Notifications** for provider test, then the test service/incident workflow for end-to-end routing.

## Configure the test

Record expected event, recipient, channel, provider, endpoint, policy step/timing, quiet-hours effect, and success evidence.

## Complete the action

1. Send the provider-level test and confirm receipt/history.
2. Trigger a synthetic incident on the test service.
3. Wait for intended route/escalation delivery.
4. Acknowledge through the intended response path.
5. Resolve and label it as a test.

## What OpsKnight does

Provider test checks base transport; synthetic incident checks intent, recipient/endpoint eligibility, scheduling/queue, provider admission/attempt, feedback, and lifecycle suppression.

## Verify it worked

Confirm one logical intent, correct recipient/channel/provider, attempt/outcome/provider ID, actual receipt, acknowledgement attribution, and no unintended later escalation.

## Change or undo the test

Resolve the test, remove temporary routing/overrides/endpoints, and retain sanitized evidence. Communicate accidental pages.

## Troubleshooting

**Provider test passes but incident fails:** trace service/policy target, user preference/endpoint, event eligibility, queue, and state suppression.

**Duplicate delivery:** inspect stable intent/delivery IDs, provider retry, repeated manual test, and policy duplication before retrying.
