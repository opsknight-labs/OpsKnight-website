# Configure responder notification preferences

## Before you begin

The administrator must configure the provider. Know which channels the escalation/service route uses and ensure the responder has a verified usable email/phone/device endpoint.

## Open the feature

Open **Settings → Profile**, then select the **Notifications** tab. The
administrator-only **Settings → Notifications** page configures providers; it
does not contain responder preferences.

## Configure preferences

1. Review each personal endpoint and its health/verification state.
2. Enable intended channels/events.
3. Configure quiet hours or opt-out behavior deliberately.
4. Save and confirm displayed state.
5. Run a controlled notification/incident test.

## What OpsKnight does

Eligibility combines service/policy intent, user preferences, endpoint health, quiet hours/opt-out, incident context, provider availability, and control-plane admission. An enabled channel without a usable endpoint cannot deliver.

## Verify it worked

Test inside and, where safe, across a quiet-hours boundary. Confirm the expected channel/endpoint is selected and delivery history records the recipient/provider outcome.

## Change or undo it

Re-enable the prior channel/window or remove an obsolete endpoint after an alternate is verified. Administrators should remove endpoints for deactivated users and update on-call/escalation ownership.

## Troubleshooting

**Preference enabled but skipped:** inspect endpoint health, quiet hours, opt-out, event/channel route, incident state, and provider status.

**Wrong endpoint used:** inspect endpoint priority/current stored values and target resolution.
