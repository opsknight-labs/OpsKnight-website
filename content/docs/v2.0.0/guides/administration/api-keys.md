# Manage API keys

![API key administration with scoped credentials and lifecycle controls](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/api-keys.png)

## Before you begin

Sign in as an administrator and identify the consumer owner, endpoints, minimum scopes, expiration, and secret manager. Effective authority is the intersection of key scopes and its owner's current product permissions.

## Open the feature

Open **Settings → API keys**. Review existing name, prefix, owner, scopes, expiry, status, and last-used evidence.

## Configure and create a key

1. Open **Settings → API keys** and create a key.
2. Name the system/environment/owner.
3. Select minimum scopes and an operational expiration.
4. Copy the secret once directly into a secret manager.
5. Make a test request and verify **Last used** changes.

The secret is displayed once. Store it in a secret manager; OpsKnight retains a
keyed hash, the visible prefix, owner, scopes, expiration, and last used time.
Send the secret as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-API-Key` where documented.

## What OpsKnight does

OpsKnight stores a keyed hash rather than a retrievable secret, plus prefix, owner, scopes, expiration, and last-used evidence. Owner deactivation or permission changes can reduce/stop key authority.

## Verify it worked

```sh
curl --fail --show-error \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPSKNIGHT_API_KEY" \
  'https://opsknight.example.com/api/incidents'
```

Confirm the expected response and **Last used** update. Where safe, verify an operation outside scope returns `403`.

## Revoke or rotate

1. Create a replacement with the same minimum scopes.
2. Update the consumer and verify its last used value changes.
3. Revoke the old key.
4. Confirm the revocation in the audit log.

Revocation is immediate. It does not delete audit history. If a secret is
exposed, revoke it before investigating the consumer.

## Troubleshooting

- `401`: the secret is missing, malformed, expired, revoked, or owned by an
  inactive user.
- `403`: authentication succeeded but the key lacks a required scope or its
  owner lacks product permission.
- No last used update: verify the header, endpoint, and that the request reached
  this OpsKnight installation.

See [Permissions and API scopes](../../reference/permissions/).

## Next steps

- Record owner, expiry, and rotation schedule.
- Review [audit logs](./audit-logs) and [permissions](./manage-permissions).
