# Review Event Logs

![Event Logs with searchable incident lifecycle events](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/event-logs.png)

## Before you begin

Use an administrator account and identify the incident, service, or approximate
event time you need to investigate.

## Open the feature

Event Logs are administrator-only incident telemetry. Open **Event Logs** to see
newest-first lifecycle events across services. The header reports matching
events, incidents and services on the current page, and pagination state.

1. Search by event message, incident ID, incident title, or service name.
2. Select a service to constrain results.
3. Open the linked incident and compare the event time/message with its timeline.
4. Move through pages when the expected event is older than the current 50-row
page.

## Configure search and filters
5. Record incident ID, service, event timestamp, message, and filter scope when
   escalating a delivery or lifecycle problem.

Event Logs differ from Audit Logs: Event Logs explain incident lifecycle and
alert transitions, while Audit Logs record administrative/entity actions. Use
the **Ingestion Simulator** only for controlled testing; do not create synthetic
events in production merely to investigate an existing incident.

## How Event Logs works

The view reads newest-first incident events and applies search/service scope
before paginating in pages of 50.

## Verify the result

Open the linked incident and confirm event order and state agree with its
timeline and current status.

## Remove or clear filters

Clear search and service filters to return to all newest-first events.

## Troubleshooting

An empty result usually means the search/service combination has no matching
events or the event is on another page. Clear filters, search by exact incident
ID, and verify the incident exists before treating the page as failed.
