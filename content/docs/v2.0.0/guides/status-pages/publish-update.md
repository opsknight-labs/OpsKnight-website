# Publish a status update

![Status page administration for production services](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/status-pages.png)

Confirm the intended page, audience, affected services, and privacy controls.
Create or update the incident announcement with customer-safe wording, then
verify the public or authenticated page through the same hostname customers use.

Internal incident visibility does not automatically define status-page output.
Review title, description, assignee, urgency, custom-field, and history exposure
settings before publishing. Confirm subscriber and webhook projection separately.
