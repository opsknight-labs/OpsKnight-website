# Publish a status update

![Status-page administration for the single supported public page](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/status-pages.png)

## Before you begin

Configure the single supported status page and map the affected services.

Identify the customer-facing impact, approved wording, affected services/components, intended component state, privacy settings, and person authorized to publish. Internal incident visibility does not automatically define public output.

## Open the feature

Open **Settings → Status page** to review the single installation-wide page and service/component mapping. During response, open the incident's status communication controls.

## Configure the update

1. Confirm the affected internal services are mapped to the intended public components.
2. Select the incident/component state that accurately describes customer impact.
3. Write a concise customer-safe title and update: impact, start/current state, mitigation or next action, and next-update expectation.
4. Review whether title, description, assignee, urgency, custom fields, timestamps, and history are allowed to cross the privacy boundary.
5. Preview where available and publish.

## What OpsKnight does

OpsKnight projects deliberately selected incident/service state into one supported status page. The projection layer controls public fields; it does not serialize the internal incident directly. Subscriber and webhook delivery are asynchronous and separate from page rendering.

## Verify it worked

Open the public or authenticated page through the same hostname/audience customers use, preferably in a signed-out/private browser. Confirm component state, wording, timestamps/history, privacy, and mobile layout. Inspect subscriber/webhook delivery separately and allow for documented cache/custom-domain delay.

## Change or undo the update

Publish a correcting/follow-up update rather than rewriting history silently. When service health is restored, publish the resolution/normal component state and verify the public page plus subscriber projections. Unmap a service only after confirming it should no longer appear; OpsKnight 2.0 supports one status page, not a second replacement page.

## Troubleshooting

**Internal incident changed but page did not:** verify deliberate publication/projection state, service mapping, projector heartbeat/backlog, and current incident generation.

**Wrong information is public:** publish a correction immediately, tighten privacy/projection settings, and review the exposure/audit trail.

**Custom domain is stale/unreachable:** compare canonical page, DNS/TLS, proxy/cache, and configured public URL before changing incident state.

**Subscribers were not notified:** inspect subscriber/webhook delivery operation separately from successful page projection.
