# Privacy retention, holds, and troubleshooting

## Request is blocked

Open the request detail, read the recorded reason, identify whether verification, assignment, ownership, a retention hold, or a dependency caused it, and resolve the source condition. Move out of `BLOCKED` only through an offered transition and retain the case evidence.

## Completed request retention is wrong

Review the completed-request retention setting. Its accepted range is 30–3650 days. Confirm cleanup jobs are healthy and that a hold intentionally preventing removal is still authorized.

## Export expired or cannot be downloaded

Confirm artifact expiry and status. Do not alter expiry in the database. If the verified request remains eligible, generate a new artifact and deliver it through the approved channel.

## Erasure conflicts with a hold

Do not bypass the hold. Escalate to the privacy/legal owner, record the decision, and leave the request blocked until the hold is released or the request is lawfully rejected.

## Audit or permission failure

Confirm the actor has the specific read/manage/export/erasure capability, not merely an administrator-looking role. Inspect application and audit logs using the request ID. Retry only after resolving the denied capability or transient failure.

## Status-page subscriber request has no automation

This is expected in 2.0. OpsKnight can create, assign, verify, transition, and audit a `STATUS_SUBSCRIBER` request, but automated export and erasure are unavailable. Use the approved manual fulfilment process, retain its evidence in the external case record, and mark the OpsKnight request complete only after verification. Never change the subject type to `USER` or operate directly on the database to bypass this boundary.
