# Operate privacy requests

Privacy Requests is the controlled workflow for a request concerning an active OpsKnight user or a status-page subscriber. The supported types are `ACCESS`, `PORTABILITY`, `RECTIFICATION`, `ERASURE`, `RESTRICTION`, and `OBJECTION`. Eligible user access, portability, and erasure requests have product automation; the other request types require documented manual review and processing. Every `STATUS_SUBSCRIBER` request requires manual fulfilment in 2.0.

The lifecycle is `RECEIVED` → `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION` → `IN_REVIEW` or verified `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED`. Operators can use `BLOCKED` or `REJECTED` where the state machine permits. Processing cannot begin without recorded identity verification.

- [Create, verify, assign, and review a request](./manage-request)
- [Export subject data](./export-data)
- [Preview and execute erasure](./process-erasure)
- [Retention, holds, and troubleshooting](./retention-and-troubleshooting)

Capabilities are separated: `PRIVACY_READ` opens the workspace, `PRIVACY_REQUESTS_MANAGE` changes lifecycle/assignment, `PRIVACY_EXPORT` creates or downloads exports, and `PRIVACY_ERASURE` executes erasure.
