# Use mobile operational views

## Before you begin

Sign in with the same role used on desktop. Mobile views preserve server authorization and may intentionally omit desktop-only administration controls.

## Open the feature

Open `/m`. Use bottom navigation for primary views and **More** for schedules, policies, services, teams, users, status, analytics, and postmortems.

## Configure the view

1. Use search/filter controls where present.
2. Select a schedule to verify current/next on-call ownership.
3. Inspect the escalation policy linked to the affected service.
4. Open service/team/user detail for ownership context.
5. Use Status for customer-facing state, Analytics for scoped trends, and Postmortems for published learning.
6. Pull or manually refresh before making an incident decision.

## What OpsKnight does

Mobile pages query the same authorized product data with compact navigation and cached-state notices. Detail links keep the mobile route family; desktop preference can redirect when explicitly selected.

## Verify the view

Cross-check one schedule owner, service-policy relationship, and active incident/status result against desktop or an API response. Confirm the timestamp and offline/cached notices before relying on the data.

## Undo or reset

Clear filters or return through mobile navigation. To switch back to desktop, use the supported desktop preference control; clear it only through the dedicated preference route when necessary.

## Troubleshooting

- **View missing:** role/authorization may hide it; confirm desktop access.
- **Data stale:** reconnect and manually refresh.
- **Unexpected desktop redirect:** review the saved desktop preference.
