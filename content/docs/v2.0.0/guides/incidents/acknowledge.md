# Acknowledge an incident

![Incident detail with response controls and timeline](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/incident-detail.png)

## Prerequisites

The incident must be visible to you and your effective permissions must include
`incident.acknowledge.scoped` or broader incident-management access.

## Steps

1. Open the incident detail page.
2. Review the service, urgency, current assignee, and response timer.
3. Select **Acknowledge** once.

## Expected result and verification

The status changes to **Acknowledged**, `acknowledgedAt` is recorded, the first
acknowledgement SLA measurement is preserved, and active escalation is stopped
or paused according to the lifecycle contract. Confirm the acknowledgement in
the header and timeline.

Acknowledgement is not assignment and does not resolve the incident.
