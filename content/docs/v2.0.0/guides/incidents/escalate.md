# Escalate an incident

![Incident detail with the active escalation state](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/incident-detail.png)

Manual escalation asks OpsKnight to execute the current step of an open incident's escalation plan immediately. In 2.0, this action is exposed only by a capability-enabled Microsoft Teams Adaptive Card. The Web incident page is used to inspect the resulting state; it has no manual **Escalate** control. Standard Slack incident actions do not expose manual escalation.

## Prerequisites

Before escalating, confirm:

- The incident is **Open**. Human-requested escalation does not advance acknowledged, snoozed, suppressed, or resolved incidents.
- The service has a valid escalation policy with at least one usable step.
- You have `incident.escalate.scoped` or broader access to this incident.
- The current step, next scheduled time, and target are appropriate.
- The incident is not already being acknowledged or escalated by another responder.

An acknowledged incident normally means somebody accepted response ownership. Coordinate with that owner instead of reopening or manipulating state merely to send another page.

## Open the feature

Open the current Microsoft Teams incident card in its configured service destination or war room. Confirm that the card shows **Escalate**. Its presence is capability- and phase-dependent; do not infer support from an old card.

## Configure and request escalation

Use the authenticated Microsoft Teams card that exposes **Escalate**.

1. Open the incident in OpsKnight Web and note its current escalation step and status.
2. In the current Microsoft Teams Adaptive Card, select **Escalate** once.
3. If prompted, confirm the incident identity.
4. Wait for the result before selecting the action again.
5. Return to the incident page and refresh its timeline and notification history.

The request acts on the incident's current escalation generation. It cannot revive work from a stale generation that was superseded by acknowledgement, snooze, suppression, resolution, or another lifecycle transition.

## Verify the result

Confirm all applicable outcomes:

1. The audit record identifies who requested manual escalation and the source channel.
2. The incident timeline includes the manual escalation request.
3. The current step and next escalation time reflect the engine result.
4. Resolved targets match the users, schedules, teams, or notification destinations configured on that policy step.
5. Notification history contains the expected durable delivery operations; inspect their status rather than assuming that a created operation was delivered.
6. No page was sent for a stale, resolved, or otherwise non-escalatable state.

If a step has no eligible target, the planner can advance to the next tier. That is a policy-resolution result, not proof that the provider failed.

## Safe retry behavior

Microsoft Teams action execution carries an idempotency context internally. A repeated Teams intent reuses the durable operation result where applicable; reusing that key for a different incident or actor is rejected.

If the UI times out, inspect the canonical incident timeline, audit log, and notification operations before retrying. Repeated clicks can make the response harder to interpret even though the underlying engine protects generation and delivery boundaries.

## Undo or correct an escalation

An emitted page cannot be recalled. Acknowledge/resolve the incident or correct the policy/service configuration according to the real response state, notify mistakenly paged responders, and document the correction. Do not repeatedly escalate to compensate for an unknown first result.

## Troubleshooting

### Escalate is unavailable

Confirm the incident is still **Open**, you can access it, and your role grants escalation. Teams also requires a linked responder identity and a current action card whose capability set and phase permit escalation. Web and standard Slack do not provide this action in 2.0.

### The result says the incident is not escalatable

Refresh the incident. Another responder may have acknowledged, snoozed, suppressed, or resolved it between card rendering and action execution. Respect the newer state.

### No responder was paged

Inspect the policy step and target-resolution result. Common causes are an empty team, no active on-call user, disabled notification method, unsupported target channel, or exhausted policy steps. Then inspect notification history for provider-specific failure.

### The card still shows the old step

Use the incident page as the source of truth. Teams cards are asynchronous projections and may lag a successful escalation.

For an immediate manual handoff outside Teams, assign or reassign the incident to the intended user or team and verify the resulting assignee notification. Assignment changes ownership; it does not execute the next escalation-policy step.

### All steps are exhausted

The incident remains open but escalation shows completed or maximum step reached. Assign a response owner directly, communicate through an approved fallback channel, and repair the policy after the immediate response is safe.

## What OpsKnight does

OpsKnight serializes the request against current incident state and escalation generation, plans the current policy step, enqueues eligible notifications, and records the result. It does not make an invalid/empty policy usable or bypass authorization.
