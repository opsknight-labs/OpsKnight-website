# Verify on-call handoffs

## Before you begin

Know the schedule time zone, next handoff time, outgoing/incoming responders, active overrides, and required coverage.

## Open the feature

Open **Schedules → select schedule** and inspect the effective on-call preview around the handoff.

## Configure the handoff

1. Verify the incoming responder is active and has usable notification destinations.
2. Inspect current, immediately-before, and immediately-after timestamps.
3. Review overrides/restrictions and the next several rotations.
4. Coordinate operational context outside the schedule state as required by team practice.

## What OpsKnight does

Schedule computation changes effective ownership at the configured boundary; it does not confirm the incoming human read a handoff message or that their provider endpoint works.

## Verify it worked

At/after the boundary, confirm current on-call is the expected responder and run a controlled [on-call test](./test-on-call). Check timeline/delivery evidence rather than only preview.

## Change or undo it

Use a bounded override to correct an immediate handoff without rewriting recurring rotation. Remove/expire the override after the coverage exception ends and verify ownership returns to the layer.

## Troubleshooting

**Preview differs from expectation:** inspect time zone, DST, layer start/interval/order, restrictions, and overlapping overrides.

**Correct responder but no delivery:** diagnose notification preferences/provider/delivery history separately.

## Next steps

- [Add an override](./overrides)
- [Test on-call](./test-on-call)
