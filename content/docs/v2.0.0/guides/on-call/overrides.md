# Add an on-call override

![Schedule detail used to verify effective coverage and overrides](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/on-call-schedule-detail.png)

## Before you begin

Identify the covered responder, replacement responder, and exact time window.

## Open the feature

Open **Schedules → select schedule → Overrides**.

## Configure the override

1. Select the replacement responder and explicit start/end times.
2. Verify effective on-call ownership inside and outside the override window.

Open the schedule, create an override with replacement responder, start, and end
times, and verify the resulting coverage preview. Use an override for a bounded
exception; edit the layer only when the recurring rotation itself is wrong.

Avoid overlapping overrides for the same responder and interval. Record times in
the schedule's displayed time zone and verify their stored UTC boundaries.

## What OpsKnight does

The bounded override replaces effective ownership during its window without rewriting recurring layer order. After the window, schedule computation returns to the underlying layers.

## Verify it worked

Inspect a timestamp before, inside, and after the window. Confirm the expected responder and run a controlled route test when the override affects production paging.

## Remove or change the override

Edit/remove the override through the schedule controls, then recheck inside/outside timestamps. For a recurring change, update the layer instead.

## Troubleshooting

**Wrong window:** verify schedule display time zone, entered local time, stored UTC boundary, and DST.

**Override loses to another exception:** inspect overlapping overrides and remove ambiguity rather than relying on implicit precedence.
