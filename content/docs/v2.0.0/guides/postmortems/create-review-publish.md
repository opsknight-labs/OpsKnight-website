# Create, review, and publish a postmortem

![Postmortem workspace for resolved incidents](/docs/v2.0.0/assets/postmortems.png)

## Before you begin

Resolve the incident first; OpsKnight rejects postmortem creation for an active
incident. Confirm the incident timeline and service ownership are accurate and
identify the review facilitator and action-item owners.

## Open the feature

Open **Postmortems**, or open a resolved incident and select **Postmortem**.

## Configure the draft

Open **Postmortems** and select **Create Postmortem**, or open a resolved
incident's **Postmortem** tab. Select the incident when prompted.

1. Enter a specific title and stakeholder summary.
2. Keep status **Draft** while evidence and reviewers are incomplete.
3. Use **Auto-Draft** when useful, then verify every generated statement against
   incident evidence; generated text is a starting point, not an approval.
4. Review and correct timeline events.
5. Record impact metrics with known units and scope.
6. Document root cause narrative, contributing factors, and Five Whys without
   reducing systemic conditions to individual blame.
7. Record resolution and lessons.
8. Add action items with owner, due date, status, priority, and an observable
   completion outcome.
9. Save, reopen, and confirm the draft retained all sections.

## How the workflow works

OpsKnight maintains one postmortem per incident and synchronizes its saved
follow-up list into operational Action Items.

## Verify, review, and publish

Run the review with incident responders and relevant service owners. Compare the
narrative to the incident timeline, alert history, and customer impact. Remove
secrets and unnecessary personal data. Resolve disputed facts in the incident
record or explicitly label uncertainty.

Change status to **Published** only after reviewers accept the learning record.
The first publication records its publication time. Publishing does not complete
action items. Use the public-status control separately when the postmortem is
appropriate for a status-page audience; verify the public rendering contains no
internal-only detail.

## Remove, archive, or follow up

Track follow-up work in **Action Items**. Completion should preserve its owner
and completion time. If Jira is connected, verify the durable issue key/link and
keep OpsKnight status consistent with the supported synchronization workflow.

Use **Archived** when the record should leave the active review set without
being deleted. Delete only when policy authorizes permanent removal; deletion
and bulk deletion are not substitutes for archival.

## Troubleshooting

- **Incident cannot be selected:** it must exist, be resolved, and be readable.
- **Edit is forbidden:** the user must be an administrator, creator, assignee,
  or qualifying service-team member under the current authorization rules.
- **Auto-Draft fails:** save manual work and review incident timeline data; do
  not block the review on generated narrative.
- **Published record is not public:** publication status and public visibility
  are separate controls.
- **Action item disappears:** save the full current action-item list; removed
  items are deleted during synchronization.
