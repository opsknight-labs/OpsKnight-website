# Notifications are not delivered

Confirm that the event is enabled for the service, the escalation target resolves,
the recipient and channel are eligible, and the endpoint is healthy. Then inspect
the notification intent, worker claim, attempt history, provider response, and
feedback status. Check quiet hours, opt-out, capacity limits, and retry schedule.
Retry only transient failures; repair or replace invalid endpoints first.

## Trace one durable notification

1. In **Settings → Notifications → Operations**, filter by incident, recipient,
   channel, and the event time.
2. If no intent exists, verify service routing, escalation target resolution,
   event type, user preferences, and endpoint eligibility.
3. If an intent is deferred, inspect quiet hours and provider admission capacity.
4. If attempts are retrying, inspect the provider code and next-attempt time.
5. If permanently failed, repair credentials or the recipient endpoint before retrying.

For voice, verify an enabled international-format phone endpoint and inspect both
Twilio gather and status callbacks. For Slack or Teams, verify every service
destination independently; one invalid channel must not be confused with the
three-destination service configuration.

Recovery is complete when the original intent reaches a terminal successful
state or a corrected retry succeeds without creating a duplicate intent. Record
notification ID, attempt IDs, provider message ID, redacted destination, status
codes, retry time, and worker lane for escalation.
