# Capacity benchmark results

These results are generated from the PR #777 certification artifact. They are
measurements from one test profile, not universal production guarantees.

> **Capacity status:** Every tested topology in this artifact is **NOT CERTIFIED**.
> Two supported variants were **NOT TESTED**. Some individual scenarios or
> correctness invariants passed, but no topology passed the complete suite.
> OpsKnight therefore publishes no certified alert, notification, user, SSE,
> or status-fanout envelope from this run.

## Current planning fixture shapes

These dimensions come from the current load-fixture source. Use them as shapes
for planning and pre-production tests. They are not the historical PR #777
input and are not certified capacity limits.

| Profile | Users | Services | Integrations/service | SSE sessions | Status subscribers |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Small | 40 | 12 | 2 | 100 | 1,000 |
| Medium | 120 | 32 | 4 | 500 | 10,000 |
| Large | 400 | 80 | 5 | 2,500 | 100,000 |
| Storm | 1,000 | 200 | 5 | 5,000 | 100,000 |

## Selected observed peaks

These are the highest measured scenario rates in the historical artifact. A
peak is an observation, not a supported-rate statement; every listed topology
failed the complete certification contract.

| Topology | Observed peak RPS | Certification |
|---|---:|---|
| Compose Split + PgBouncer | 230.5 | **NOT CERTIFIED** |
| Swarm HA Split + PgBouncer | 104.6 | **NOT CERTIFIED** |
| Helm Split + PgBouncer | 95.5 | **NOT CERTIFIED** |
| Kustomize Split + PgBouncer | 66.1 | **NOT CERTIFIED** |

> The benchmark artifact was produced from product revision
> `52d6a3c5c791e7ad9ad21cd76f11cbdf11d3176f`. The harness was later revised at
> `e2cd6e28092f544eea2342ebe455cac680fd157b`, and the benchmark was not rerun after that
> harness change. The results remain historical evidence, not a certification of

## How to use these results

Use the failures to choose what to observe and scale, not as sizing promises.
See [Scaling signals](./scaling-signals/) and [Certification methodology](./certification-methodology/).
Numeric production guidance will be published only after a topology reaches
**CERTIFIED** status.
