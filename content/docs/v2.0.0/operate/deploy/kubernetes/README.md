# Deploy OpsKnight on Kubernetes

OpsKnight provides two maintained Kubernetes packaging paths: [Helm](../helm/) for schema-validated values and a migration hook, and [Kustomize](../kustomize/) for platform-owned overlays. Both use the same image, runtime roles, database contracts, health endpoints, and public-origin requirements.

## Installation path

1. Complete [cluster prerequisites](./prerequisites).
2. Configure [secrets](./secrets) and the [database](./database).
3. Choose [integrated](./integrated) or [split](./split) runtime.
4. Configure [ingress and TLS](./ingress) and [NetworkPolicy](./network-policy).
5. Install with [Helm](../helm/) or [Kustomize](../kustomize/).
6. Complete public HTTPS [initial setup](../../../start/initial-setup), verify [Application URL and host routing](../application-url-and-host-routing), and sign in through the same hostname.
7. Complete the [production checklist](./production-checklist).

Use [Kubernetes troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) for Pod, migration, readiness, database, policy, URL, and queue failures.
