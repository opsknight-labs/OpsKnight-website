# Install and operate Runbook Agents

Runbook Agents execute host, container, and Kubernetes actions without accepting inbound connections. Each Agent generates an Ed25519 key pair locally, enrolls with a single-use 15-minute token, signs every request, long-polls for work, renews its lease while running, and keeps unsent results in a durable local spool.

The Agent is separate from the Runbook Worker. The worker plans and reconciles database state; the Agent is the constrained execution plane close to the target.

## Runbook authoring and operations UI

Advanced JSON edits are not saved implicitly. An unapplied-changes warning remains visible even when switching editor tabs, and draft saving is disabled until the JSON is applied to the builder or discarded with **Refresh JSON from builder**. Step editor identity remains stable during reordering and key edits.

The dedicated browser suite covers publication, service attachment and target selection, trigger configuration, incident suggestions, exact-plan approval, and cancellation. A separate journey covers enrollment, pool membership, scoped secret grants, and rotation. These tests use an isolated database and seed asynchronous worker transitions; they never execute host remediation. First-class nested precheck/verification editing and server-side library/execution pagination remain follow-up product work.

The Runbooks library supports search, published/draft filters, and creation templates. Edit a draft through the ordered step builder and each step's configuration panel; define typed inputs in the Inputs tab. Advanced JSON is an explicit alternative, not the primary editor. Save the draft before publishing: the publish confirmation publishes only the saved version. Published versions remain immutable.

Service bindings show their selected version, target, inputs, and triggers together. Use **Configure** to change them. Machine-specific write actions cannot target a multi-member `LOCAL_HOSTS` pool; choose a specific Agent instead. Incident executions show ordered step progress and approvals for the exact frozen action and parameters. Cancellation, publication, revocation, and detach operations require confirmation.

**Runbooks → Agents** separates Agents, Pools, and Secrets. Pool membership and scoped secret grants are managed in their configuration panels; secret values remain masked and can be rotated without displaying the existing value. Secret-backed steps require HTTPS between the Agent and control plane. An HTTP polling Agent reports an explicit HTTPS-required error instead of receiving secret material.

**Runbooks → Health** shows queue and safety indicators, Agent heartbeat/spool attention, and worker state visible to the current process. In split deployments, a web process cannot certify the whole worker fleet; monitor each worker readiness endpoint separately. Execution-signing identity rotation and fleet/load certification remain separate future work.

## Safe enrollment sequence

1. In **Runbooks → Agents**, create an Agent and copy its one-time token.
2. Create or review a local `policy.json`. Start with diagnostics only.
3. Persist `/var/lib/opsknight-agent`; it contains the private identity and result spool.
4. Supply the token through a protected environment or Secret and start exactly one Agent.
   Also pin `OPSKNIGHT_EXECUTION_PUBLIC_KEY` from the trusted **Runbooks → Agents** page. The setup snippets include this value. Agents refuse unsigned or altered execution envelopes.
5. Confirm the Agent becomes `ONLINE`, reports a policy hash, and has spool depth zero.
6. Add it to a `LOCAL_HOSTS` pool for machine-local actions or a `SHARED_TARGET` pool for a common cluster/API target.
7. Grant each referenced secret to only that Agent or pool.

Do not share an identity volume between running replicas. A token is single-use. Create a distinct enrollment for every independent Agent.

Keep bootstrap Secrets while deployment manifests reference them. Once enrolled, the Agent uses its persisted identity and does not read the consumed token again. Removing a still-referenced Kubernetes/Swarm Secret can prevent redeployment. A native environment token can be removed after enrollment; always keep the pinned execution public key.

## Local policy

`agent/policy.container.json` is the fail-closed diagnostics-only baseline; `agent/policy.example.json` demonstrates an explicitly allowlisted native service. `allowedStepTypes` enables executors; the Systemd unit, Docker container, Kubernetes namespace, and Bash command lists further constrain targets. A trailing `*` is the only wildcard for resource-name allowlists. Bash commands require an exact match so an allowed prefix cannot append another shell operation. Non-idempotent actions remain disabled unless `allowNonIdempotent` is explicitly enabled.

Platform authorization is a second boundary. Kubernetes RBAC, Docker socket access, Unix permissions, sudoers, or polkit must grant only the operations the local policy allows. A policy entry never grants an operating-system permission by itself.

Validated runbook inputs are exposed to child processes as `OPSKNIGHT_INPUT_<UPPERCASE_KEY>`. Secret-reference inputs are resolved only after a scoped grant check and their values are redacted from previews and uploaded output before leaving the Agent. Avoid printing credentials even with this defense.

Restart the Agent after changing policy. Verify that the policy hash changes in the Agent screen.

## Docker Compose

```sh
export OPSKNIGHT_AGENT_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN='<single-use-token>'
export OPSKNIGHT_AGENT_IMAGE='ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight-agent:2.0.0'
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml \
  -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.agent.yml up -d opsknight-agent
```

For split Compose, set `OPSKNIGHT_AGENT_URL=http://opsknight-web:3000`. Mount the Docker socket only when Docker actions are required and accepted by your threat model. Host Systemd actions should use the native service instead of a container.

## Helm

Create the enrollment Secret outside Helm, then enable the single-replica Agent:

```sh
kubectl -n opsknight create secret generic opsknight-agent-enrollment \
  --from-literal=OPSKNIGHT_AGENT_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN='<single-use-token>' \
  --from-literal=OPSKNIGHT_EXECUTION_PUBLIC_KEY='<public-key-from-Agents-page>'

helm upgrade --install opsknight deploy/kubernetes/helm/opsknight \
  --namespace opsknight -f values.production.yaml \
  --set agent.enabled=true \
  --set agent.enrollmentToken.existingSecret=opsknight-agent-enrollment
```

The chart grants no Kubernetes resource privileges or global HTTPS egress by default. To enable Kubernetes actions, add narrow namespaced `agent.rbac.rules`, align `agent.policy.kubernetesNamespaces`, and allow only the cluster control-plane endpoint through `agent.networkPolicy.kubernetesApiCIDRs`. Keep the Agent PVC across upgrades because it stores identity and queued results.

## Kustomize

Use `profiles/integrated-agent` or `profiles/split-agent`. Create the externally managed `opsknight-agent-enrollment` Secret before applying the profile; the component deliberately does not generate or commit token material. Pin both application and Agent images by digest. The component starts diagnostics-only with empty RBAC; an overlay enabling Kubernetes actions must also add narrow Role rules and an `ipBlock` egress rule for the cluster API endpoint.

```sh
kubectl -n opsknight create secret generic opsknight-agent-enrollment \
  --from-literal=enrollment-token='<single-use-token>' \
  --from-literal=OPSKNIGHT_EXECUTION_PUBLIC_KEY='<public-key-from-Agents-page>'
kubectl kustomize deploy/kubernetes/kustomize/profiles/split-agent > /tmp/opsknight.yaml
kubectl apply -f /tmp/opsknight.yaml
```

## Docker Swarm

Create an external Raft secret and deploy the Agent overlay with the selected integrated or split stack:

```sh
printf '%s' '<single-use-token>' | docker secret create opsknight_agent_enrollment_token -
export OPSKNIGHT_EXECUTION_PUBLIC_KEY='<public-key-from-Agents-page>'
export OPSKNIGHT_AGENT_IMAGE='ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight-agent:2.0.0'
docker stack deploy --with-registry-auth \
  -c deploy/swarm/docker-stack.yml \
  -c deploy/swarm/docker-stack.agent.yml opsknight
```

Use `OPSKNIGHT_AGENT_URL=http://opsknight-app:3000` with the integrated stack. The overlay deliberately runs one replica with a persistent identity volume.

## Native Linux service

OpsKnight provides an automated, self-contained enterprise installer that supports Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04/26.04, Debian 12/13, RHEL 9/10, Rocky, AlmaLinux, and SLES 15 SP3+ (requires glibc ≥ 2.28; SLES 15 GA-SP2 with glibc 2.26 is unsupported) on both `x86_64` and `arm64/aarch64`. The installer provisions a bundled Node 24 LTS runtime (pinned v24.21.0), eliminating host Node.js and external repository dependencies.

### Standard Layout & File Permissions

| Directory / File | Ownership | Permissions | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/opt/opsknight-agent/` | `root:root` | `0755` | Standalone binary and bundled Node 24 runtime (`runtime/bin/node`) |
| `/etc/opsknight-agent/policy.json` | `root:opsknight-agent` | `0644` | Local capability allowlist and action policy |
| `/etc/opsknight-agent/agent.env` | `root:root` | `0600` | Sensitive enrollment tokens, control plane configuration, and execution keys |
| `/var/lib/opsknight-agent/` | `opsknight-agent:opsknight-agent` | `0700` | Private identity (`identity.json`), leases, and durable spool |

### One-Command Installation

1. Generate a one-time enrollment token and note the execution signing public key in **Runbooks → Agents → Enroll Agent**.
2. Run the official installer on your target host (tokens can also be passed via `--token-file` to avoid process table exposure):
   ```bash
   sudo ./deploy/agent/install.sh \
     --url https://opsknight.company.com \
     --key "<BASE64_EXECUTION_PUBLIC_KEY>" \
     --token <ONE_TIME_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN>
   ```
   For staged signing key rotation, pass the plural key map via `--keys-json` (copy the exact JSON displayed in **Runbooks → Agents → Pinned execution public key**; key IDs are `"default"` and stage UUIDs, not `"active"`/`"next"`):
   ```bash
   sudo ./deploy/agent/install.sh \
     --url https://opsknight.company.com \
     --keys-json '{"default":"<BASE64_SPKI_KEY>","87ddce2f-34a1-4321-9876-abcdef012345":"<BASE64_NEXT_KEY>"}' \
     --token <ONE_TIME_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN>
   ```
3. Run diagnostic preflight checks (must run as root to inspect `root:root 0600` `agent.env`):
   ```bash
   sudo /opt/opsknight-agent/preflight.sh
   ```
4. Enable and start the systemd service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now opsknight-agent
   sudo systemctl status opsknight-agent
   ```

### Transactional Upgrades & Rotation

To upgrade an existing native Agent installation, re-run `install.sh` pointing to the new release or artifact tarball with verified checksum:
```bash
sudo ./deploy/agent/install.sh \
  --url https://opsknight.company.com \
  --tarball /path/to/opsknight-agent-linux-x64.tar.gz \
  --checksum "<SHA256_HASH>"
```
The installer executes transactionally:
1. Validates the new bundle in an isolated staging directory and enforces SHA256 integrity.
2. Drains in-flight executions before restarting an active process.
3. Preserves existing private identity in `/var/lib/opsknight-agent` and local policy in `/etc/opsknight-agent/policy.json`.
4. Atomically replaces `/opt/opsknight-agent` with full backup and automatic rollback on activation failure.
5. Reloads systemd units (`systemctl daemon-reload`).
6. Restarts the active service automatically if it was running. To defer the restart, supply `--no-restart`.

### Host-Native Container & Kubernetes Privileges

Because `opsknight-agent.service` runs unprivileged under `NoNewPrivileges=true` and `ProtectHome=true`:
- **Systemd Executor**: Grant narrow Polkit authorization rules for the unprivileged `opsknight-agent` user (e.g. in `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-opsknight-agent.rules`), rather than sudoers.
- **Docker**: Adding `opsknight-agent` to the host `docker` group (`sudo usermod -aG docker opsknight-agent`) grants root-equivalent control over the host. If your security policy prohibits Docker socket access for non-root services, prefer rootless Podman or narrow Polkit rules.
- **Podman**: Configure rootless Podman socket access or system service connections; do not expose unauthenticated TCP sockets.
- **Kubernetes**: Due to `ProtectHome=true`, store kubeconfig files in `/etc/opsknight-agent/kubeconfig` rather than home directories, and reference it via `KUBECONFIG` in `/etc/opsknight-agent/agent.env`. Narrow RBAC permissions to only allowlisted namespaces.

### Systemd Executor & Polkit Privileges

Example Polkit authorization rule in `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-opsknight-agent.rules`:
```javascript
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units" &&
        subject.user == "opsknight-agent" &&
        action.lookup("unit") == "dummy-web.service") {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
```

### Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pgrep: command not found` | Missing `procps` / `procps-ng` | Run installer or install `procps-ng` (RHEL) / `procps` (Debian). |
| `EACCES /var/lib/opsknight-agent` | Incorrect permissions on state directory | Verify `chown -R opsknight-agent:opsknight-agent /var/lib/opsknight-agent` and `chmod 0700`. |
| `Permission denied reading agent.env` | Running preflight without root | Run `sudo /opt/opsknight-agent/preflight.sh` (`agent.env` is mode `0600 root:root`). |
| `Agent request timestamp is outside allowed window` | Clock drift $>60\text{s}$ | Synchronize system clock via `chrony` (`chronyc tracking`) or `timedatectl`. |
| `Unsupported architecture` | Host architecture other than `x86_64` or `arm64` | Deploy Agent on supported 64-bit x86 or ARM Graviton architecture. |
| `Bundled node binary failed to execute` | Incompatible libc (glibc < 2.28) | Deploy on supported OS with glibc ≥ 2.28 (e.g. SLES 15 SP3+, RHEL 9+, AL2023, Ubuntu 22.04+). |
| `Agent offline after reboot` | Unpersisted state directory or network delay | Verify `/var/lib/opsknight-agent` mounts across reboot; systemd unit waits for `network-online.target` and `time-sync.target`. |


## Monitoring and recovery

Use **Runbooks → Health** and Prometheus metrics to watch Agent status, active attempts, total spool depth, attempt states, and oldest pending age. Alert on stale heartbeats, non-zero spool depth that continues growing, repeated local-policy denial, and queue age above the execution SLO.

Cancellation is cooperative: OpsKnight marks the request, the lease heartbeat observes it, and the Agent sends `SIGTERM` to the process group followed by `SIGKILL` after five seconds. A timed-out or lost write action can become `UNKNOWN`; verify the external target before retrying.

The Agent maintains a monotonic local lease timer and stops the process group ten seconds before its last known authority expires. Failed renewals never extend that timer. Lease renewal and start acknowledgements are signed, and repeated `/start` calls acknowledge the same lease without extending it. Keep Agent and control-plane clocks synchronized. A durable dispatch marker prevents the same identity from executing a replayed attempt twice.

Results and redacted full output are written and fsynced to the local spool before artifact upload or result submission. They are removed only after a signed server acknowledgement. Terminal rejections move to `spool/dead-letter`; transient network, rate-limit, and server failures remain pending. Review quarantined records locally and monitor `opsknight_runbook_agent_dead_letter_depth`; quarantine preserves evidence and does not automatically repeat remediation.

Automatic retries are restricted to read-only failures. HTTP POST/PATCH, service or container restarts, and Kubernetes rollout restarts require non-idempotent risk classification. A command failure or timeout after a write starts is recorded as `UNKNOWN`, including results from older Agents that report these failures as `FAILED`. Do not start another remediation until you have checked the target's actual state.

The Agent start fence checks the execution deadline, cancellation, and Agent revocation. Lease renewal requests cancellation immediately when the execution deadline passes. A bounded, signed result produced before the deadline can recover an expired lease's unknown outcome when no safe retry has superseded it.

Incident suggestions start the exact version displayed, even after a newer version is published. Before approving a step, review its resolved action, resource, Agent or pool, version checksum, and timeout. Scoped secret values remain hidden. Secret metadata and grants are visible only to users with secret-management permission.

Suggestions also freeze their normalized inputs and Agent/pool target. Binding edits do not change those snapshots. Suggestions created before the snapshot migration must be dismissed and regenerated. Only inputs referenced by the current step's templates or explicit `OPSKNIGHT_INPUT_*` environment names are delivered to its Agent process; unrelated secrets are never resolved for that step.

## Upgrade and capacity verification

Apply the database migrations before updating Web and Runbook Worker replicas. The execution signing private key is generated once and stored encrypted in PostgreSQL; keep the database and encryption-key backups together. Existing Agents must add the pinned public key shown on the Agents page before upgrading. Compose and Swarm use `OPSKNIGHT_EXECUTION_PUBLIC_KEY`; Helm and Kustomize read that key from their existing enrollment Secret. Every independent Agent needs its own identity volume; Helm enforces one replica per identity.

The legacy all-job worker now reconciles Runbooks too. For production workload isolation, continue to use the dedicated Runbook lane: a rejected automatic binding is recorded independently and does not prevent other bindings from starting.

Fault-injection tests cover Agent crash/restart during artifact upload, renewal connectivity loss, exact start retries, trigger isolation, frozen suggestions, and signed payload tampering. These tests establish correctness under those failures; they are not fleet load certification. Before sizing a large fleet, measure idle-Agent and reconnect QPS, concurrent Runbook backlog, paging latency, database connections, and artifact WAL/backup growth. Artifacts remain bounded to 1 MiB compressed each in PostgreSQL with retention cleanup; plan storage capacity accordingly.

To replace a compromised Agent, revoke it in the UI, remove its identity volume, create a new enrollment, and review its secret grants. Revocation immediately prevents future signed claims. Output artifacts default to 30-day retention; set `RUNBOOK_ARTIFACT_RETENTION_DAYS` (1–3650) on the integrated runtime or dedicated Runbook Worker to match your incident-data retention policy.

## Secret transport and host targeting

Signed envelopes provide integrity, not confidentiality. Secret-backed steps require an
HTTPS Agent control-plane URL. The server excludes secret-bearing claims over HTTP before
resolving secrets; non-secret steps may still use the internal HTTP defaults in Compose,
Swarm, Helm and Kustomize. Configure the Agent URL to your trusted HTTPS ingress for secrets.
When TLS terminates at a proxy, enable `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` only if that proxy overwrites
`X-Forwarded-Proto` and direct access to the backend is blocked. Ambiguous protocol chains
are rejected. A development-only override requires both `NODE_ENV=development` and
`OPSKNIGHT_ALLOW_INSECURE_AGENT_SECRETS=true` on the server and Agent; it is ignored in production.

Machine-specific writes require a specific Agent. `SHARED_TARGET` pools allow any member;
multi-member `LOCAL_HOSTS` pools reject Agent writes until a specific Agent is selected.
Claims recheck this boundary if membership changes after execution creation. Read-only
pool execution may choose any initial member, with local-host retries pinned to that member.

Corrupt spool records are quarantined independently. Dead-letter results keep Agent health
degraded until reviewed. Dispatch markers expire after two days, beyond the maximum execution
and signed lease lifetime, rather than reopening replay immediately after acknowledgement.
