# Install OpsKnight on Docker Swarm

Use Swarm when it is already your production scheduler and OpsKnight must run across Docker hosts. Swarm can replace application tasks; it does not make bundled PostgreSQL highly available.

## Installation path

1. Complete [Swarm prerequisites](./prerequisites).
2. Choose integrated/split and bundled/external database in [topology and database](./topology-and-database).
3. Follow the script-driven [installation](./install).
4. Complete public HTTPS [initial setup](../../../start/initial-setup) and verify [Application URL and host routing](../application-url-and-host-routing).
5. Complete the [production checklist](./production-checklist).
6. Use [upgrade and rollback](./upgrade) and [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting).

Use external HA PostgreSQL, an external TLS load balancer, durable backups, and at least three managers for a production HA objective.
