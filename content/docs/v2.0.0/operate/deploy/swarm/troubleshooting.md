# Troubleshoot OpsKnight on Docker Swarm

## Before you begin

Capture node/quorum, stack services/tasks, service inspect, recent task logs, images, networks, secrets metadata, and database/provider health. Never print secret contents.

## Manager quorum is unhealthy

**Check:** manager reachability/state and Raft quorum.

**Recovery:** follow the established Swarm disaster-recovery procedure before any application deployment.

**Verify:** managers agree and stack/service operations succeed.

## Service does not converge

**Check:** `docker service ps --no-trunc`, placement constraints, node capacity/labels, image pull, secrets, overlay network, and health checks.

**Recovery:** correct the exact scheduler/task failure and let the maintained deploy script complete.

**Verify:** desired/actual replicas match without repeated replacement.

## Migration task fails

**Check:** task logs, direct database route, TLS/CA, credentials/privileges, image revision, and schema state.

**Recovery:** keep rollout blocked, correct the cause, and rerun the one-shot migration through maintained tooling.

**Verify:** exit zero precedes application convergence.

## Bundled database will not schedule

**Check:** `opsknight.database=true` node label, node availability, storage volume, placement, and resources.

**Recovery:** restore the intended durable node or execute database recovery; do not schedule the service onto an empty volume unintentionally.

**Verify:** expected database data/readiness is present before application rollout.

## Overlay network or load balancer fails

**Check:** Swarm TCP/UDP ports, MTU, node private addresses, published port, load-balancer target health, proxy headers/TLS/SSE.

**Recovery:** correct network or proxy infrastructure without exposing database/private pool ports.

**Verify:** external readiness, sign-in, realtime update, and signed webhook pass.

## Queue grows with healthy tasks

**Check:** role heartbeat, lane age/throughput, provider throttling, database/pool saturation, and correct runtime mode.

**Recovery:** remove the bottleneck and scale only with capacity headroom.

**Verify:** oldest age declines and synthetic incident completes.

## Bootstrap code generation fails in interactive shell

**Check:** when issuing a bootstrap authorization code inside an interactive container shell (`docker exec -it ... sh`), `DATABASE_URL` is not automatically exported into the shell session because Swarm injects credentials as secret files (`DATABASE_URL_FILE`). Running `node scripts/create-bootstrap-code.mjs` directly will fail to connect to the database.

**Recovery:** If running inside an interactive shell (`docker exec -it ... sh`): Export the Swarm secret before running the script:

```sh
export DATABASE_URL="$(cat "$DATABASE_URL_FILE" | tr -d '\r\n')"
node scripts/create-bootstrap-code.mjs
```

**Verify:** the script prints the one-time administrator setup code and its expiration timestamp.
