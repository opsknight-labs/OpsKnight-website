# Install OpsKnight with Helm

Helm is the packaged Kubernetes path. The chart supports integrated or split runtime, bundled or external PostgreSQL, split-mode PgBouncer, ingress, migration hooks, disruption budgets, NetworkPolicy, autoscaling, and Prometheus Operator discovery.

## Installation path

1. Complete [Kubernetes prerequisites](../kubernetes/prerequisites).
2. Review [Helm values](./values) and create production secrets.
3. Follow the complete [installation](./install).
4. Choose [integrated](./integrated) or [split](./split).
5. Add [external PostgreSQL](./external-postgres), [PgBouncer](./pgbouncer), and [ingress](./ingress) when required.
6. Complete public HTTPS [initial setup](../../../start/initial-setup) and verify [Application URL and host routing](../application-url-and-host-routing).
7. Complete the [production checklist](../kubernetes/production-checklist), then use [upgrade](./upgrade) and [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) for lifecycle operations.

Do not use chart placeholder secrets or mutable images in production.
