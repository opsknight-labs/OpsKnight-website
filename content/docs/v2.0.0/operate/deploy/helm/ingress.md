# Configure ingress with Helm

## Prerequisites

Provide an ingress controller, DNS, trusted TLS certificate workflow, and known proxy chain. Read the common [Kubernetes ingress guide](../kubernetes/ingress) and [reverse-proxy contract](../reverse-proxy-contract).

## Prepare the configuration

Set chart public URLs to the exact HTTPS origin. Enable ingress and configure class, host, path, TLS Secret, certificate annotations, SSL redirect, disabled SSE buffering, suitable timeouts, and bounded request size. Configure `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` for trusted host/protocol forwarding and `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` separately for client-IP resolution. Configure NetworkPolicy ingress namespace labels.

## Deploy ingress

Render the chart and inspect the Ingress target Service/port, host, TLS, annotations, and policy selectors. Apply through the normal Helm installation/upgrade.

## Verify public behavior

Check Ingress, Service, endpoints, and public readiness. Verify sign-in/callback origins, a live incident update, a signed webhook, and configured OIDC/ChatOps callbacks. Compare an in-cluster request if public access fails.

## Operate it in production

Monitor certificate expiry, TLS/upstream errors, SSE disconnects, callback failures, and body-limit rejections. Trust forwarding headers only from the known chain.

## Troubleshooting

**404/503:** inspect ingress class/rules, Service/endpoints, and readiness.

**Wrong redirect:** correct chart public URLs, forwarded host/protocol, and `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS`; roll Web/application.

**SSE or webhook fails:** correct buffering/timeouts or preserve signed raw body/headers and documented size limits.

## Change or remove ingress

Validate new hostname and every callback before retiring the old route. Keep HTTPS rollback available; never expose an unauthenticated direct port as fallback.
