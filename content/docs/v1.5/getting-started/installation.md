# Installation

Use the installation method that matches what you are trying to prove.

For a first evaluation, prefer Docker Compose. It has the fewest moving parts and is the path used by [Getting Started](./README).

## Choose an install path

| Goal | Recommended path |
| --- | --- |
| Evaluate OpsKnight locally | Docker Compose |
| Validate Kubernetes behavior | Kustomize profile |
| Operate with configurable Kubernetes packaging | Helm |
| Develop OpsKnight itself | From source |

Do not start with a production-style Kubernetes deployment if your only goal is to understand the incident workflow. Prove the application path first, then introduce infrastructure complexity.

## Docker Compose

Clone the repository and create a local environment file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opsknight-labs/OpsKnight.git
cd OpsKnight
cp env.example .env
```

Generate the required application secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Set at least:

```dotenv
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=PASTE_BASE64_OUTPUT
ENCRYPTION_KEY=PASTE_64_HEX_CHARACTER_OUTPUT
```

Then start OpsKnight:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and complete `/setup`.

For the complete first-run workflow, return to [Getting Started](./README).

## Kubernetes

OpsKnight includes Kubernetes deployment assets for environments that need separate runtime roles, horizontal web scaling, and database connection management.

Before production use:

- use a persistent PostgreSQL deployment appropriate for your environment;
- configure secrets through your platform's secret-management mechanism rather than committing them;
- set the public application URLs to the externally reachable HTTPS address;
- verify web, worker, and scheduler roles are healthy;
- test ingress, DNS, TLS, storage, and backup behavior independently of the application;
- run a synthetic incident after deployment to verify the entire path.

Use the existing deployment documentation for the specific profile and operational details. Until the full v1.5 deployment reference is published, refer to the [v1.4 deployment guide](/docs/v1.4/deployment).

## From source

Use a source install when developing OpsKnight or debugging application behavior.

Follow the repository's development prerequisites and environment example rather than treating a development server as a production deployment.

## Verify any installation

After startup, check the application health endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Then create a synthetic incident. Infrastructure health alone does not prove that service ownership, escalation, event ingestion, and incident lifecycle behavior are configured correctly.

## Next step

Continue with [Getting Started](./README) and verify one complete incident lifecycle before adding optional integrations or production controls.
