## Quick Setup Checklist

When setting up OpsKnight for your organization, complete these administrative tasks:

### 1. Configure Notification Channels

Without notifications, OpsKnight can't alert responders. Set up at least one channel:

| Priority                | Channel | Setup Guide                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Essential**           | Email   | [SMTP/SendGrid/Resend setup](./administration/notifications#email)        |
| **Recommended**         | Slack   | [Slack OAuth integration](./integrations/communication/slack-oauth-setup) |
| **For Critical Alerts** | SMS     | [Twilio/AWS SNS setup](./administration/notifications#sms)                |
| **For Mobile**          | Push    | [FCM/OneSignal setup](./administration/notifications#push)                |

### 2. Set Up Authentication

Choose your authentication strategy:

| Option              | Best For                 | Setup                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Local Auth**      | Small teams, quick start | Default, no config needed           |
| **Google SSO**      | Google Workspace orgs    | [OIDC setup](./security/oidc-setup) |
| **Microsoft Entra** | Microsoft 365 orgs       | [OIDC setup](./security/oidc-setup) |
| **Okta/Auth0**      | Enterprise with IdP      | [OIDC setup](./security/oidc-setup) |

### 3. Create Teams and Invite Users

1. **Create teams** to organize responders
2. **Invite users** via email
3. **Assign roles** (User, Responder, Admin)
4. **Add users to teams** with appropriate roles

### 4. Configure Data Retention (Optional)

Set retention policies based on your compliance needs:

- **Incidents**: 2 years (default)
- **Alerts**: 1 year (default)
- **Logs**: 90 days (default)

### 5. Review Audit Logs

Understand what's being tracked:

- Login attempts
- User management changes
- Configuration changes
- Data access events

---

## Accessing Admin Settings

### Via UI

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Sections available depend on your role:
   - **Users**: Everyone can access their profile
   - **Teams**: Team admins can manage their teams
   - **System Settings**: Admin role required

### Via API

Admin endpoints require admin API keys:

```bash
# List users (admin only)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_admin_xxx" \
  https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/users
```

---

## Admin Roles and Permissions

| Role          | Capabilities                                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**      | View incidents, acknowledge, basic profile settings  |
| **Responder** | All User permissions + on-call + incident management |
| **Admin**     | All permissions + system settings + user management  |

### What Admins Can Do

- Configure notification providers (Email, SMS, Push)
- Set up SSO/OIDC integration
- Manage all users (invite, disable, change roles)
- Configure custom fields
- Set data retention policies
- View and export audit logs
- Configure system settings (App URL, encryption)

---

## System Health Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint

```bash
curl https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/health
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### What to Monitor

| Component         | What to Check                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Database**      | Connection status, query performance |
| **Job Queue**     | Pending jobs, failed jobs            |
| **Notifications** | Delivery success rate                |
| **Integrations**  | Webhook success rate                 |

---

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data

OpsKnight stores sensitive configuration that should be protected:

| Data             | Storage  | Protection        |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| API keys         | Database | Encrypted at rest |
| OAuth tokens     | Database | Encrypted at rest |
| SMTP credentials | Database | Encrypted at rest |
| User passwords   | Database | Bcrypt hashed     |

### Access Control

- Use **SSO** when possible for centralized identity management
- Enable **MFA** at your identity provider
- Review **audit logs** regularly
- **Rotate API keys** periodically
- Use **least privilege** — only grant Admin role when necessary

### Data Privacy

- Configure **data retention** to meet compliance requirements
- Incidents and alerts are deleted after retention period
- **Audit logs** have separate retention (typically longer)
- Consider **GDPR/CCPA** requirements for user data

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Notifications Not Sending

1. Check provider configuration in Settings → Notifications
2. Verify credentials are correct
3. Test with "Send Test" button
4. Check system logs for errors
5. Verify user has notifications enabled

### Users Can't Log In

1. Check user status (ACTIVE, DISABLED, INVITED)
2. For SSO: Verify OIDC configuration
3. For local auth: Check password requirements
4. Review audit logs for failed login attempts
5. Check rate limiting (lockout after failures)

### Data Not Appearing

1. Check data retention settings
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check if data was deleted by retention policy
4. Review system logs for errors
