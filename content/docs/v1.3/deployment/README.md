# Deployment

OpsKnight v1.3 ships one Next.js application and PostgreSQL-backed state. Choose a deployment path based on who owns the database, ingress, secrets, upgrades, backups, and background jobs.

## Choose a path

| Path                                 | Use when                                                           | Important boundary                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Docker Compose](./docker)           | Evaluation, development, or a deliberate single-host installation. | One host and one PostgreSQL container are not highly available.             |
| [Kubernetes/Kustomize](./kubernetes) | Your platform team owns raw manifests/overlays.                    | The supplied PostgreSQL StatefulSet is a single-instance starting topology. |
| [Helm](./helm)                       | Your platform team wants a values-driven Kubernetes release.       | Render and validate chart values against cluster policy before install.     |

`k8s/kustomization.yaml` is the raw-manifest entry point. [Mobile/PWA](./mobile-pwa) is a client-access guide, not a server deployment method.

## Shared production requirements

- Supported PostgreSQL with durable storage, backups, and tested recovery.
- Stable public HTTPS origin used consistently for `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- Strong, backed-up `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and 64-hex-character `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- Ingress/reverse-proxy forwarding of the original host and scheme.
- Restricted database/admin network access.
- Monitoring for readiness, restarts, migration failures, database capacity, and integration/notification failures.
- An immutable image release process with an explicit schema/data rollback decision.

Notification credentials are configured in the application UI and encrypted in PostgreSQL. A working recovery therefore requires both the database backup and the matching `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## Runtime model

```text
users and integrations
        │ HTTPS
        ▼
ingress / reverse proxy
        │
        ▼
OpsKnight Next.js application
        │
        ▼
PostgreSQL
```

The application also performs internal scheduled work by default. Set `ENABLE_INTERNAL_CRON=false` only when another designated process owns those jobs. When running several replicas, validate job locking and database connection capacity under the exact topology.

Redis is not a required v1.3 runtime dependency.

## Core configuration

| Variable              | Requirement                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Complete PostgreSQL URI reachable from the application process.           |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`        | Exact public authentication origin.                                       |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public origin used in user-facing links; normally matches `NEXTAUTH_URL`. |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`     | Stable high-entropy session/token secret.                                 |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`      | Stable 32-byte hex key for encrypted stored credentials.                  |

For managed PostgreSQL, TLS/PgBouncer options, or credentials containing reserved URI characters, use the deployment method's complete database-URL override instead of reconstructing the URI from unencoded components.

See the [Configuration reference](../getting-started/configuration) for advanced settings. Notification-provider credentials are normally entered under **Settings → Notification Providers** rather than invented environment variables.

## Published image compatibility

Stable images are published only at `ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight`; main-branch validation images use `ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight-test`. Do not substitute the test channel in production.

Source changes do not modify an image that was already published. In particular, the immutable `1.3.1` release predates the fail-closed migration entrypoint and multi-architecture publishing changes in this repository revision and is an amd64 image. Tagged stable releases are built for amd64 and arm64, while the continuously updated test image from `main` is amd64-only to keep feedback fast. Those runtime changes take effect in the next stable release built after this work. Inspect the selected image manifest and release notes rather than inferring capabilities from the checked-in deployment YAML.

## Release workflow

Use the same gates for every deployment method:

1. Pin the intended application image tag/digest.
2. Review release notes and Prisma migrations.
3. Back up PostgreSQL and critical secrets; keep a recent restore drill.
4. Render/validate deployment configuration.
5. Roll out while watching migration/startup logs.
6. Verify readiness, login, a database write, an inbound test event, and intended notification providers.
7. Observe for a defined soak period before deleting the prior recovery point.

Images built from this repository revision run `prisma migrate deploy` before starting the server. The entrypoint retries/recovery-attempts migration failures, but if the schema still cannot be migrated the container exits non-zero. Verify the release notes before assuming an older image has this behavior.

Kubernetes deployments include a startup probe budget so legitimate migration/cold-start time is not mistaken for a liveness failure.

## Backup and recovery standard

Back up:

- complete PostgreSQL data;
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and secrets managed outside the database;
- Compose environment, Kubernetes overlays, Helm values, ingress/network policy configuration;
- the exact application image reference.

Restore into an isolated environment with the original encryption key, then verify authentication, integrations, status configuration, and a controlled incident.

## Production acceptance checklist

- [ ] Public URL is HTTPS and matches both application URL settings.
- [ ] Database is not exposed publicly and uses encrypted transport where supported.
- [ ] Persistent storage and automated backups are in place.
- [ ] A restore drill succeeded with the backed-up encryption key.
- [ ] Health/readiness and database capacity are monitored externally.
- [ ] Migration/application logs reach durable log storage.
- [ ] Resource requests/limits or host capacity are based on a load test.
- [ ] Notification/inbound-integration synthetic tests are monitored.
- [ ] Upgrade and data-rollback ownership is documented.
- [ ] Destructive reset commands are excluded from routine runbooks.
