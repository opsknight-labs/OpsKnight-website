# PagerDuty Events API v2 ingest

OpsKnight can accept the **PagerDuty Events API v2** JSON shape (`trigger`, `acknowledge`, `resolve`) on its own host. That is an ingest adapter: keep the payload, point the URL at OpsKnight. It is not a PagerDuty product, not affiliated with PagerDuty, and not a guarantee that every third-party “PagerDuty integration” will work without testing.

You can often keep existing Alertmanager, Terraform, or script payloads. Confirm against the routes and fields below.

## 🎯 Supported Endpoints

OpsKnight accepts PagerDuty v2 events on two routes:

- **Canonical ingest URL**:
  `POST https://your-opsknight.com/api/integrations/pagerduty/v2/enqueue`
- **Short URL**:
  `POST https://your-opsknight.com/api/integrations/pagerduty`

---

## 🔑 Authentication & Routing

OpsKnight accepts the integration routing key in these locations:

1. Root JSON `routing_key` or `routingKey`.
2. `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY`.
3. `X-Routing-Key: YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY`.
4. Query parameter `?key=YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY` or `?token=YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY`.

You can instead include `?integrationId=INTEGRATION_ID`, but the request must still provide the matching key in one of the supported locations above. `Authorization: Token token=…` and a `routing_key` query parameter are not accepted by the current v1.3 route.
