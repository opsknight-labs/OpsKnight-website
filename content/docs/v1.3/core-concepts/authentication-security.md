# Authentication and Security

OpsKnight implements defense-in-depth to protect authentication flows, sessions, and sensitive data.

## Security Controls

| Risk              | Protection                     | Notes                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Brute force       | Rate limiting + lockouts       | Progressive lockouts after failures   |
| User enumeration  | Uniform responses              | Same response for valid/invalid users |
| Session hijacking | Token versioning               | Invalidates old sessions immediately  |
| Timing attacks    | Constant-time responses        | Prevents side-channel leaks           |
| Privilege abuse   | Audit logging + admin controls | Sensitive actions logged              |

## Rate Limiting

Login attempts are tracked by email + IP.

| Lockout Count | Duration   |
