# Postmortems

Postmortems (also called Post-Incident Reviews or PIRs) document what happened during an incident, why it happened, and what you'll do to prevent recurrence. OpsKnight provides a structured workflow for creating, reviewing, and tracking postmortems.

## Why Postmortems Matter

| Without Postmortems         | With Postmortems                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Same incidents repeat       | Learn and prevent recurrence     |
| Tribal knowledge            | Documented institutional memory  |
| Blame culture               | Blameless improvement culture    |
| No accountability for fixes | Tracked action items with owners |

---

## Postmortem Workflow

OpsKnight postmortems follow a structured lifecycle:

```
DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED
```

### Workflow States

| Status        | Description                         | Who Can Edit               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **DRAFT**     | Initial creation, work in progress  | Author, Editors            |
| **IN_REVIEW** | Ready for team review and feedback  | Author, Editors, Reviewers |
| **PUBLISHED** | Finalized, visible to organization  | Admins only                |
| **ARCHIVED**  | Historical record, no longer active | Admins only                |

### State Transitions

## When to Write a Postmortem

### Required Triggers

| Condition                          | Rationale                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Any HIGH urgency incident**      | Critical issues need documentation |
| **Customer-impacting outage**      | External impact requires review    |
| **Data loss or security incident** | Compliance and learning            |
| **Incident duration > 1 hour**     | Extended incidents have lessons    |

### Recommended Triggers

| Condition                          | Rationale                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Recurring incident pattern**     | Break the cycle            |
| **Near-miss (almost critical)**    | Learn before it gets worse |
| **Novel failure mode**             | Document new knowledge     |
| **Cross-team coordination issues** | Process improvements       |

### Skip Postmortem When

- Incident was false positive
- Root cause is already well-documented
- No meaningful learnings possible
- Incident was immediately auto-resolved

## Postmortem Sections

### Summary

A brief executive summary (2-3 sentences) answering:

- What happened?
- What was the impact?
- How was it resolved?

**Example**:

> On January 15, 2024, the Payment API experienced a 45-minute outage due to a database connection pool exhaustion. Approximately 2,300 transactions failed during the incident. Service was restored by increasing connection pool limits and restarting affected pods.

### Timeline

Chronological sequence of events with timestamps.

| Time  | Event                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 14:00 | Monitoring alert triggered for elevated API latency           |
| 14:03 | On-call engineer acknowledged alert                           |
| 14:08 | Initial investigation started, high DB connection count noted |
| 14:15 | Root cause identified: connection pool exhausted              |
| 14:22 | Mitigation applied: increased pool size                       |
| 14:30 | Service restored, monitoring confirmed                        |
| 14:45 | Incident resolved, follow-up tasks created                    |

**Timeline Best Practices**:

- Use consistent timezone (UTC recommended)
- Include who performed each action
- Note key decisions and why they were made
- Include any false starts or dead ends

### Impact

Quantify the business and customer impact.

| Impact Type             | Measurement              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Duration**            | 45 minutes               |
| **Affected Users**      | ~2,300 customers         |
| **Failed Transactions** | 2,347                    |
| **Revenue Impact**      | $12,500 estimated        |
| **SLA Breach**          | Yes, 99.9% target missed |
| **Support Tickets**     | 47 tickets opened        |

### Root Cause

Technical explanation of why the incident occurred.

**Structure**:

1. **What failed**: The specific component or system
2. **Why it failed**: The technical reason
3. **Why wasn't it caught**: Detection gaps

**Example**:

> The database connection pool was configured with a maximum of 50 connections, inherited from initial deployment 2 years ago. Recent traffic growth increased average concurrent connections from 30 to 48. A traffic spike from a marketing campaign pushed connections over the limit, causing new requests to queue and timeout.
>
> The connection pool metrics were not monitored, so the gradual increase went unnoticed until the hard failure.

### Resolution

Steps taken to restore service.

| Step | Action                           | Result                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1    | Increased connection pool to 100 | Pending connections processed |
| 2    | Restarted 3 affected API pods    | Fresh connection pools        |
| 3    | Verified transaction processing  | Normal throughput resumed     |
| 4    | Monitored for 15 minutes         | No recurrence                 |

### Action Items

Tracked tasks to prevent recurrence.

| Action                           | Owner  | Due Date | Priority | Status |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| Add connection pool monitoring   | @jane  | Jan 22   | HIGH     | Open   |
| Set up alerts at 80% pool usage  | @jane  | Jan 22   | HIGH     | Open   |
| Review all DB connection configs | @bob   | Jan 29   | MEDIUM   | Open   |
| Document connection pool sizing  | @alice | Feb 5    | LOW      | Open   |

### Lessons Learned

Key takeaways for the team.

**What went well**:

- Alert fired within 3 minutes of issue
- On-call responded quickly
- Root cause identified in 12 minutes

**What could be improved**:

- No monitoring on connection pool utilization
- Initial config was never revisited as traffic grew
- Runbook didn't cover connection pool issues

**Where we got lucky**:

- Traffic spike was moderate; larger spike would have been worse
- Database itself remained healthy

## Best Practices

### Blameless Culture

| Do                             | Don't                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Focus on systems and processes | Blame individuals            |
| Ask "what" and "how"           | Ask "who"                    |
| Assume good intentions         | Assume negligence            |
| Treat failures as learning     | Treat failures as punishment |

### Writing Quality

- **Be specific**: Include exact times, metrics, commands
- **Be factual**: Document what happened, not opinions
- **Be complete**: Don't skip uncomfortable details
- **Be constructive**: Every problem needs an action item

### Timing

| Phase            | Target                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Draft started    | Within 24 hours of resolution |
| Draft completed  | Within 48 hours               |
| Review completed | Within 1 week                 |
| Published        | Within 2 weeks                |

### Action Items

- Make them **specific** and **measurable**
- Assign **one owner** (not a team)
- Set **realistic due dates**
- **Track to completion** (don't let items rot)
- **Link to tickets** in your issue tracker

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Create Postmortem

1. Verify incident is **resolved**
2. Check you have permission (incident participant or team member)
3. Verify postmortem feature is enabled

### Can't Publish

1. Check all required sections are completed
2. Verify all reviewers have approved (if reviews required)
3. Check you have publish permission

### Action Items Not Syncing

1. Verify integration is connected
2. Check issue tracker permissions
3. Review sync logs in integration settings
