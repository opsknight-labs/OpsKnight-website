# Urgency and Severity Mapping

OpsKnight normalizes alerts into a standard Severity and Urgency model so notifications are consistent across providers.

## Severity (Event Level)

| Severity | Meaning                               | Maps to Urgency |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Critical | System down or unusable               | HIGH            |
| Error    | Significant degradation               | MEDIUM          |
| Warning  | Minor issue or approaching limits     | MEDIUM          |
| Info     | Informational / recovery / normal ops | LOW             |

> **Note**: Warning maps to MEDIUM (not LOW) to ensure important alerts are not missed. This aligns with industry best practices where warnings often indicate issues that need attention before they become critical.

## Urgency (Notification Level)

| Urgency | Behavior                                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIGH    | Pages on-call immediately (SMS, Push, Phone)              |
| MEDIUM  | Standard notification (Slack, Email)                      |
| LOW     | Logged for visibility, optional low-priority notification |

| warning | Warning  | LOW     |
| info    | Info     | LOW     |

### Uptime Tools

| Status        | Severity | Urgency |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- |

| up / resolved | Info     | LOW     |

## Custom Webhooks

You can set severity directly in your payload:

```json
{
  "summary": "Database High CPU",
  "severity": "critical",
  "source": "custom-script"
}
```

## Notes

- Mapping logic lives in integration adapters and event processing.
- Use consistent severity values for predictable escalation.
