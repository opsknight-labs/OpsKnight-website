## Mobile-Specific UI

### Touch Targets

All interactive elements are sized for touch:

- **Buttons**: Minimum 44px tap target
- **List items**: Full-width tap area
- **Checkboxes**: Enlarged for touch

### Swipe Gestures

Some views support swipe gestures:

- **Pull to refresh** — Update incident list
- **Swipe to action** — Quick acknowledge/snooze/resolve (where enabled)

### Haptics & Feedback

- **Haptic feedback** — Subtle tap feedback for primary actions
- **Skeleton loading** — Placeholder layouts reduce perceived load time

### Responsive Layout

The UI adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Phone (< 640px)** — Single-column layout
- **Tablet (640-1024px)** — Two-column where appropriate
- **Desktop (> 1024px)** — Full desktop experience

---

## Troubleshooting

### Push Notifications Not Working

1. **Check permission** — Ensure notifications are allowed in browser/OS settings
2. **Check device registration** — Verify in Profile → Devices
3. **Check quiet hours** — Make sure you're not in quiet hours
4. **Reinstall PWA** — Remove and re-add to home screen

### PWA Not Installing

1. **Use Safari (iOS)** — Chrome on iOS can't install PWAs
2. **Check HTTPS** — PWAs require HTTPS
3. **Clear cache** — Try clearing browser data
4. **Check manifest** — Verify service worker is loading

### Slow Performance

1. **Check connection** — PWA needs good connectivity
2. **Clear cache** — Remove and reinstall PWA
3. **Check device** — Older devices may be slower
4. **Reduce data** — Filter incident lists to smaller sets

---

## Best Practices

### For Responders

- **Install the PWA** — Better experience than browser
- **Enable push** — Don't miss critical alerts
- **Check schedules** — Know when you're on-call
- **Use quick actions** — Acknowledge from notifications

### For Administrators

- **Encourage PWA installation** — Send setup instructions
- **Configure push** — Set up Firebase or OneSignal
- **Test notifications** — Verify delivery on mobile
- **Monitor device registrations** — Check users have devices registered
