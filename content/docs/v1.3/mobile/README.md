# Mobile

OpsKnight includes a touch-oriented application under `/m`. It uses the same account, roles, data, and server-side authorization as the desktop application. It can run in a browser or as an installed Progressive Web App (PWA).

Use mobile for incident response and read-oriented operational checks. Use desktop mode for configuration workflows that do not have a mobile editor.

Start with [Mobile setup](./setup). Operators should also complete the production checklist in [Mobile PWA](../deployment/mobile-pwa).

## Navigation

The bottom navigation contains **Home**, **Incidents**, **Services**, **Alerts**, and **More**. **More** links to teams, users, schedules, policies, analytics, postmortems, status, profile settings, help, PWA installation, theme, app lock, push, and desktop mode.

Route visibility does not grant permission. Server-side authorization still applies to every action, and a deployment can restrict what a user can read or change through roles and ownership rules.

## Respond to an incident

1. Open **Alerts** or **Incidents**, then open the incident.
2. Confirm the service, urgency, status, assignee, and newest timeline entries.
3. Select **Acknowledge** to signal ownership.
4. Use **More** to add a note, take ownership, change urgency, snooze, or reassign.
5. Resolve with a meaningful resolution note; the mobile detail flow requires at least 10 characters.
6. Reload the incident and confirm the server-side timeline reflects the action.

List cards also expose swipe/touch actions where supported. Avoid gestures while a card is already updating, and verify the resulting status instead of assuming animation equals server acceptance.

## Install and push

The manifest starts installed sessions at `/m`, requests standalone display and portrait orientation, and uses application icons supplied by the deployment. Production PWA behavior requires HTTPS and a working generated `/sw.js`.

Open **More → Install OpsKnight** when the browser exposes the prompt, or use the browser's Add to Home Screen action. Then open **More → Push Notifications**, grant permission, and send the built-in test.

Push requires a valid VAPID configuration, browser Push API support, Service Worker support, and operating-system permission. A subscription is not proof of end-to-end paging: trigger a synthetic incident and verify the notification opens the intended incident or alerts route.

See [Mobile PWA](../deployment/mobile-pwa) for deployment configuration, browser limitations, service-worker behavior, and troubleshooting.

## Offline support matrix

OpsKnight provides selected offline assistance, not a fully offline incident system.

### Last-known reads

The mobile clients store encrypted last-known list data in browser `localStorage` for:

- incidents;
- notifications;
- services, including each search-specific result set;
- schedules; and
- teams, including each search-specific result set.

These caches can be empty, stale, evicted, or cleared. Encryption uses application code available to the browser and is not a substitute for device encryption, screen lock, or remote wipe. Detail pages, home, policies, users, analytics, postmortems, status, and help do not have a documented offline-read guarantee.

### Queued writes

The request queue uses browser IndexedDB. Only these mobile client actions enqueue a request after a network failure while the browser reports offline:

- from the incident list: set status to `ACKNOWLEDGED`, `SNOOZED`, or `RESOLVED`;
- from Alerts: mark one notification read; and
- from Alerts: mark all notifications read.

Creating incidents, incident-detail actions, notes, urgency changes, assignment, schedule or policy administration, and all other writes require a connection.

Queued requests are retried by background sync when supported, an online event, or a manual sync signal. They can remain queued after authentication, timeout, rate-limit, or server failures, and can be removed after a non-retryable response. Browser storage loss removes them entirely. After reconnecting, reload the affected record and verify server state.

## Mobile preferences and security

- **Theme** follows the selected light, dark, or system preference.
- **App Lock** is a local privacy screen when the app returns from the background. It does not replace the OpsKnight session, device passcode, full-disk encryption, MDM, or remote wipe.
- **Push Notifications** registers the current browser subscription with OpsKnight.
- **Switch to Desktop Mode** sets the desktop preference and leaves the `/m` interface. Clear or change that preference through the application when returning to automatic mobile routing.

Do not share an installed authenticated PWA between responders. Sign out before transferring a device, and clear site data when retiring it.

## Troubleshooting

**The browser opens desktop instead of `/m`**

Open `/m` directly. If **Switch to Desktop Mode** was selected earlier, the desktop-preference cookie can suppress automatic mobile routing.

**A mobile page says to use desktop**

The route is intentionally read-only. Follow its desktop link or select **More → Switch to Desktop Mode**.

**Cached data differs from the server**

Reconnect and reload. Last-known data has no freshness guarantee and must not be used as final evidence of acknowledgment, ownership, or resolution.

**An offline action did not synchronize**

Open the affected incident or notification online. Repeat the action only after checking current server state, because another responder may have changed it while this device was offline.

**Push does not arrive**

Check HTTPS, browser and OS permission, `/sw.js`, VAPID configuration, the device subscription, notification history, and provider logs. See [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) for deployment checks.
