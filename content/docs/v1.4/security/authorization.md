# Authorization and Roles

OpsKnight has workspace-wide application roles and independent team-scoped roles. Always evaluate both, plus resource assignment and ownership, when deciding who can perform an operation.

## Workspace roles

| Role        | Operational boundary                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USER`      | Standard signed-in user. Resource checks may allow incidents, services, schedules, or metrics related to their assignment/team. |
| `RESPONDER` | Global response operations, including broad incident and operational-resource management, but not Admin-only governance.        |
| `ADMIN`     | Workspace governance, users, providers, system/security settings, and destructive administrative operations.                    |

The implementation uses action-specific checks; a role name is not a guarantee that every route has identical behavior. Test critical controls after each release.

## Resource checks for a User

The central v1.4 checks allow a regular `USER` to:

- view or modify an incident when assigned to it or a member of the service's owning team;
- modify a service when a member of its owning team;
- view a schedule when assigned to a layer or referenced by an override;
- read scoped service/team metrics only for teams they belong to.

Responders and Admins bypass those central resource checks for global operational access. An unscoped metrics request from a regular User is denied.

## Team roles

| Team role | Scope                                                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MEMBER`  | Team participation and routing eligibility.                                                     |
| `ADMIN`   | Elevated team classification; it does not grant workspace Admin.                                |
| `OWNER`   | Team governance, including elevated team-role and membership operations implemented for Owners. |

Application Admins and Responders can create/edit teams and add Members. Only application Admins or that team's Owners can assign `OWNER`/`ADMIN`; removal and sensitive membership operations use Admin-or-Owner checks. Only an application Admin can delete a team. The last Owner cannot be removed or demoted.

## High-impact task matrix

| Task                                                          | Minimum implemented authority                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manage workspace users and application roles                  | Application Admin                                            |
| Configure OIDC, providers, retention, and system settings     | Application Admin                                            |
| View System Logs                                              | Application Admin                                            |
| Create/manage incidents globally                              | Responder or Admin                                           |
| Create/edit services, schedules, policies, and teams globally | Responder or Admin                                           |
| Delete a team or perform protected destructive governance     | Application Admin                                            |
| Assign elevated team roles                                    | Application Admin or that team's Owner                       |
| Access a User-scoped operational resource                     | Assignment/team relationship required by that resource check |

Consult the task guide because some workflows add stricter checks and some read-only pages are available to every signed-in user. For example, the v1.4 Audit Log page is not Admin-gated.

## Least-privilege workflow

1. Grant `USER` by default.
2. Use team membership and assignment for scoped participation.
3. Grant `RESPONDER` only for people who need workspace-wide response operations.
4. Grant `ADMIN` only for governance and security duties.
5. Keep at least two active Admins and two Owners on critical teams.
6. Review application roles, team roles, assignments, OIDC mappings, and API keys separately.
7. Revoke sessions and IdP access for urgent removals; then test affected response paths.

## OIDC role-mapping warning

Role mapping runs on OIDC login and can change application roles. Protect mapped claims at the IdP, put Admin rules first only when intentional, and test both promotion and demotion. Team roles are not assigned by the OIDC role-mapping rules.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] A User cannot open Admin-only settings or system logs.
- [ ] A User can access only expected assigned/team resources.
- [ ] A Responder can operate incidents without administering identity or providers.
- [ ] Team Owner does not imply workspace Admin.
- [ ] Removing membership removes the expected resource scope.
- [ ] OIDC group removal changes access as designed on the next login.
- [ ] Break-glass Admin access and session revocation are tested.
