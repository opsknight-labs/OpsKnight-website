# Upgrade and Rollback

An OpsKnight release can change the application image, database schema, deployment configuration, service worker, and client assets. Rollback safety depends primarily on whether the new database migrations remain compatible with the previous application.

## Prepare

1. Pin the new image by tested immutable tag or digest; record the currently running digest.
2. Compare release notes, `prisma/migrations`, environment/configuration changes, Helm values/manifests, and browser/PWA changes.
3. Run migration validation and rehearse the release against a recent restored database.
4. Back up PostgreSQL and the matching `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and deployment configuration.
5. Define the maintenance window, rollback decision owner, acceptance checks, and soak period.
6. Pause unrelated administrative changes and confirm notification providers have a fallback communication path.

Never depend on a floating `latest` tag as your rollback record.

## Deploy

### Docker Compose

Update the application image reference to the tested version, then:

```bash
docker compose pull opsknight-app
docker compose up -d opsknight-app
docker compose logs --tail=300 opsknight-app
```

### Helm

Render and review before applying:

```bash
helm lint helm/opsknight --values values.production.yaml
helm template opsknight helm/opsknight --namespace opsknight \
  --values values.production.yaml > opsknight-rendered.yaml

helm upgrade opsknight helm/opsknight --namespace opsknight \
  --values values.production.yaml --wait --timeout 10m
```

### Kustomize

Pin the new image in the reviewed overlay, render it, use server-side dry run, then apply:

```bash
kubectl kustomize k8s > opsknight-rendered.yaml
kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f opsknight-rendered.yaml
kubectl apply -f opsknight-rendered.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/opsknight -n opsknight --timeout=10m
```

## Acceptance gate

Do not call the upgrade complete until all checks pass:

- startup logs show migrations completed and migration health is clean;
- liveness and readiness succeed without restart loops;
- local and OIDC authentication work according to policy;
- an ordinary user can read and write permitted data;
- a synthetic provider event triggers, deduplicates, acknowledges, and resolves;
- schedules/escalation select the intended responder;
- email/SMS/push/Slack or the deployment's required channels deliver;
- public status, RSS/subscriber behavior, webhooks, and mobile PWA work where enabled;
- logs, scheduler ticks, database capacity, and error rates remain within baseline through the soak period.

## Choose rollback type

**Application-only rollback** is appropriate only when the previous image is compatible with the current migrated schema and configuration. Pin the previous image digest, deploy it, and repeat the acceptance gate.

**Application and database rollback** is required when a migration is destructive or the previous image cannot use the new schema. Freeze writes, preserve the failed state for investigation, restore the pre-upgrade database and matching secrets, deploy the previous image/configuration, and verify before reopening traffic.

`helm rollback`, a Kubernetes image rollback, or changing a Compose tag affects application resources; it does not reverse PostgreSQL migrations or data transformations. Never use those commands as a substitute for a database recovery decision.

## Partial rollout and PWA considerations

Avoid serving incompatible application versions simultaneously during schema transitions. With multiple replicas, watch per-pod image versions and migration logs until every pod is ready.

The service worker activates immediately in production and can retain cached shell assets. After an upgrade, test an installed PWA as well as a clean browser session. If a mobile client behaves inconsistently, confirm the deployed `/sw.js`, close/reopen the PWA, and use the documented browser cache recovery steps before concluding the server rollback failed.
