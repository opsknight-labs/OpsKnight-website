# Command Center

The Command Center at `/` is the shared operational landing page. It combines current incident pressure with a filtered incident preview, service risk, on-call coverage, SLA warnings, action items, and recent trends.

For user-owned executive or role-specific layouts, use [Reports and Dashboards](./reports-dashboards). For deeper metric definitions and exports, use [Analytics](./analytics).

## Read system status

The top-level status is calculated from active incidents:

| Status      | Condition                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Critical    | At least one active High-urgency incident        |
| Degraded    | Active incidents exist, but none is High urgency |
| Operational | No active incidents                              |

“Active” refers to incident work that has not been resolved and excludes states that the current metric explicitly omits. Always open the filtered incident list before treating the badge as a full service-health diagnosis.

## Command Center summary

The header summarizes the selected range and current workload, including total incidents, active/open work, resolved and acknowledged counts, unassigned incidents, and High-urgency active incidents. A retention indicator appears when the requested history is clipped by the installation's retention policy.

Selecting a summary link opens the corresponding incident view.

## Filter the incident preview

Use quick filters for:

- all incidents;
- incidents assigned to you;
- unassigned Open incidents;
- High, Medium, or Low urgency.

Advanced filters support:

| Filter   | Supported values                                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Search   | Incident text supported by the dashboard query            |
| Service  | One service or all services                               |
| Status   | Open, Acknowledged, Resolved, Snoozed, Suppressed, or all |
| Assignee | One user, unassigned, or all                              |
| Urgency  | High, Medium, Low, or all                                 |
| Range    | Preset range or custom start/end dates                    |
| Sort     | Newest, oldest, status, urgency, or title                 |

The dashboard incident preview is limited to 20 matching records. Open **Incidents** for the full paginated list.

## Ops Pulse

Ops Pulse highlights three current queues:

- **My Queue** — active incidents directly assigned to the signed-in user;
- **Critical Focus** — up to three active High-urgency incidents;
- **Services at Risk** — services with active incidents, including critical counts.

These cards are shortcuts into the underlying incidents and services. They do not replace escalation ownership or a schedule coverage check.

## Smart Insights

The Command Center applies deterministic rules to the current data and can show:

- a workload warning when more than 30% of active incidents are unassigned;
- a critical spike when three or more High-urgency incidents are active;
- service concentration when one service contributes at least three incidents and 40% or more of the selected volume;
- an unusual-volume message when the current count exceeds the comparison baseline used by the component;
- a positive “all clear” message when no incidents are open.

These are rule-based hints, not AI root-cause analysis. Dismissing a hint hides it in the current client state; it does not change incidents.

## Operational widgets

Depending on the available data, the page includes widgets for:

- on-call now and schedule coverage;
- incidents approaching or breaching service SLA targets;
- action-item progress and overdue work;
- incident heatmap and recent incidents;
- service health and active incident distribution;
- response metrics derived from the same analytics engine used by Analytics.

Open the linked guide when a widget identifies a problem:

- [Schedules](./schedules) for coverage;
- [Incidents](./incidents) for response;
- [Services](./services) for routing and targets;
- [Action Items](./action-items) for corrective work;
- [Analytics](./analytics) for metric definitions.

## Live updates and refresh

The dashboard is server-rendered and wrapped by a real-time client that listens to `/api/realtime/stream`. A live event refreshes dashboard data. Network interruptions can delay updates; verify a critical change on the incident page or refresh the browser if the dashboard looks stale.

## Export

The Command Center can export its current incident data and summary metrics to CSV in the browser. The file includes the active filters, headline counts, and incident rows loaded by the view. For the richer server-generated export and larger result set, use [Analytics](./analytics#export-csv).

Review exported incident titles, services, and assignees before sharing the file outside the organization.

## Search

The sidebar and mobile experiences also expose application search backed by `/api/search`. Search results are navigational and permission-aware according to the underlying pages. Do not treat search as an audit or export interface.

## Keyboard navigation

Shortcuts are ignored while typing in an input, text area, or editable field.

| `G`, then `A` | Analytics                                             |
| `C`           | Open Quick Create                                     |
| `N`           | Create an incident when already in the Incidents area |
| `Esc`         | Close a modal or dialog where supported               |

The shortcut overlay in some v1.4 builds also lists Command/Ctrl combinations that are not wired by the global handler. Use the verified shortcuts above until that product inconsistency is fixed.

## Accessibility

The application includes skip links, visible focus handling, semantic controls, and keyboard-accessible dialogs. Use the browser's normal zoom rather than relying on a wall-display mode. Report any control that cannot be reached or identified with a keyboard or screen reader as an accessibility defect.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                    | Check                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Counts differ from the incident list       | Match status, urgency, service, assignee, range, and retention scope. The dashboard preview is limited. |
| A card is empty                            | Clear filters and confirm qualifying data exists. Empty data is not necessarily an error.               |
| My Queue is empty                          | It shows incidents directly assigned to your user, not every incident owned by your teams or schedules. |
| Status looks stale                         | Open the incident, verify connectivity to the real-time stream, and refresh.                            |
| Historical range is shorter than requested | Read the retention notice and ask an administrator to review data-retention settings.                   |
| Export omits older matches                 | The Command Center exports rows loaded by its view; use Analytics export for a larger filtered set.     |
